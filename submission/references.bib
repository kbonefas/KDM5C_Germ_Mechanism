  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for most models of learning, memory and development in neural circuits. To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.},

  abstract = {Summary                        Female mammalian cells harbor two X chromosomes, one of maternal and one of paternal origin. During development, one X randomly inactivates             1–4             . This renders either the maternal or paternal X active, causing X mosaicism that varies among individual females, with some showing considerable or complete skew in the general female population             5–7             . Parent-of-X-origin can modify epigenetics via DNA methylation             8, 9             and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in aging and disease. However, whether X skewing – or its mosaicism – alters functions in females is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew toward the maternal X (Xm) influences key functions of the body. Among cardiac, bone, metabolic, and brain functions, Xm selectively impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biologic or epigenetic aging of the female hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory. Xm showed epigenetic imprinting of several genes within hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. Thus, the maternal X chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain aging, and silenced genes. Understanding how the maternal X impairs brain function could lead to new understanding of female heterogeneity in cognitive heath and to X chromosome-derived pathways against cognitive deficits and brain aging.},

The JARID1C protein functions as a histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase and is involved in the demethylation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2.|Mutation analysis of the JARID1C gene was conducted in the following cohorts: probands from 23 XLMR families linked to Xp11.2, 92 males with mental retardation and short stature, and 172 probands from small XLMR families with no linkage information.|Four novel mutations consisting of two missense mutations, p.A77T and p.V504M, and two frame shift mutations, p.E468fsX2 and p.R1481fsX9, were identified in males with mental retardation. Two of the mutations, p.V504M and p.E468fsX2, are located in the JmjC domain of the JARID1C gene where no previous mutations have been reported. Additional studies showed that the missense mutation, p.V504M, was a de novo event on the grandpaternal X chromosome of the family. Clinical findings of the nine affected males from the four different families included mental retardation (100\%), short stature (55\%), hyperreflexia (78\%), seizures (33\%) and aggressive behaviour (44\%). The degree of mental retardation consisted of mild (25\%), moderate (12\%) and severe (63\%).|Based on the clinical observations, male patients with mental retardation, short stature and hyperreflexia should be considered candidates for mutations in the JARID1C gene.},

  abstract = {Summary             It is generally believed that the first organisms did not age, and that aging thus evolved at some point in the history of life. When and why this transition occurred is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Recent reports of aging in bacteria suggest that aging predates the emergence of eukaryotes and originated in simple unicellular organisms. Here we use simple models to study why such organisms would evolve aging. These models show that the differentiation between an aging parent and a rejuvenated offspring readily evolves as a strategy to cope with damage that accumulates due to vital activities. We use measurements of the age‐specific performance of individual bacteria to test the assumptions of the model, and find evidence that they are fulfilled. The mechanism that leads to aging is expected to operate in a wide range of organisms, suggesting that aging evolved early and repeatedly in the history of life. Aging might thus be a more fundamental aspect of cellular organisms than assumed so far.},

  abstract = {During embryogenesis, primordial germ cells (PGCs) have the potential to enter either spermatogenesis or oogenesis. In a female genital ridge, or in a non-gonadal environment, PGCs develop as meiotic oocytes. However, male gonadal somatic cells inhibit PGCs from entering meiosis and direct them to a spermatogenic fate. We have examined the ability of PGCs from male and female embryos to respond to the masculinising environment of the male genital ridge, defining a temporal window during which PGCs retain a bipotential fate. To help understand how PGCs respond to the male gonadal environment, we have identified molecular differences between male PGCs that are committed to spermatogenesis and bipotential female PGCs. Our results suggest that one way in which PGCs respond to this masculinising environment is to synthesise prostaglandin D2. We show that this signalling molecule can partially masculinise female embryonic gonads in culture, probably by inducing female supporting cells to differentiate into Sertoli cells. In the developing testis, prostaglandin D2 may act as a paracrine factor to induce Sertoli cell differentiation. Thus part of the response of PGCs to the male gonadal environment is to generate a masculinising feedback loop to ensure male differentiation of the surrounding gonadal somatic cells.},

This child first presented at 30 months of age with stereotyped and repetitive behaviors, impairment in social reciprocity and in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors, and developmental delay primarily in the language domain. A diagnosis of autism was made and subsequently confirmed at the current age of 47 months. Cytogenetic and fragile X studies were normal. Mutational analysis revealed a novel missense mutation in exon 16 of the JARID1C gene that results in an arginine to tryptophan substitution at amino acid 766 (R766W). Sequence alignment analysis with multiple available eukaryotic sequences including the homologous proteins of mouse and zebrafish demonstrated that the affected amino acid is conserved. JARID1C has not previously been implicated in autism susceptibility. Recent novel molecular evidence suggests that it is a histone demethylase specific for di- and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and functions as a transcriptional repressor by fostering REST-mediated neuronal gene regulation. The JARID1C-regulated genes SCN2A, CACNA1H, BDNF, and SLC18A1 have previously been associated with autism and cognitive dysfunction. This patient brings the total number of reported JARID1C mutations to 14. This presentation both extends the range of neurocognitive phenotypes attributable to mutations in this gene and illustrates the importance of molecular studies and DNA sequence analysis for accurate diagnosis of monogenic causes of autism.},

To study the possible involvement of TRH neurons in learning and memory processes, gene expression of TRH, its receptors, and pyroglutamyl peptidase (PPII), were measured in limbic regions of water-maze trained rats. Hypothalamus and amygdala showed changes related to the task but not specific to spatial learning while in hippocampus, pro-TRH and TRH-R1 mRNA levels were specifically increased in those animals trained to find a hidden platform. Variation of TRH content and mRNA levels of pro-TRH, TRH-R1, TRH-R2 and PPII are observed in conditions known to activate TRH hypophysiotropic neurons. Changes in some of these parameters could indicate the activation of TRHergic neurons and their possible involvement in some memory related process.

TRH content and TSH serum levels were determined by radioimmunoassay; mRNA levels of pro-TRH, TRH-R1, TRH-R2, and PPII, by RT-PCR. Exclusive changes due to spatial training were observed in posterior hippocampus of rats trained for 5 days sacrificed after 60min: decreased TRH content and increased mRNA levels of pro-TRH and TRH-R1, particularly in CA3 region (measured by in situ hybridization). The hypothalamus-pituitary axis responded in both yoked and trained animals (increasing serum TSH levels and pro-TRH expression, due to swim-stress); in the amygdala of both groups, pro-TRH expression increased while diminished that of both receptors and PPII. Differential expression of these parameters suggests involvement of TRH hippocampal neurons in memory formation processes while changes in amygdala could relate to TRH anxiolytic role. The differential modulation in anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus is discussed.},

  abstract = {Mammalian evolution is believed to be male driven because the greater number of germ cell divisions per generation in males increases the opportunity for errors in DNA replication. Since the Y Chromosome (Chr) replicates exclusively in males, its genes should also evolve faster than X or autosomal genes. In addition, estimating the overall male-to-female mutation ratio (alpha m) is of great importance as a large alpha m implies that replication-independent mutagenic events play a relatively small role in evolution. A small alpha m suggests that the impact of these factors may, in fact, be significant. In order to address this problem, we have analyzed the rates of evolution in the homologous X-Y common SMCX/SMCY genes from three different species–mouse, human, and horse. The SMC genes were chosen because the X and Y copies are highly homologous, well conserved in evolution, and in all probability functionally interchangeable. Sequence comparisons and analysis of synonymous substitutions in approximately 1kb of the 5' coding region of the SMC genes reveal that the Y-linked copies are evolving approximately 1.8 times faster than their X homologs. The male-to-female mutation ratio alpha m was estimated to be 3. These data support the hypothesis that mammalian evolution is male driven. However, the ratio value is far smaller than suggested in earlier works, implying significance of replication-independent mutagenic events in evolution.},

Using direct in situ hybridisation Smcx was mapped to the distal end of the mouse X chromosome (XF2-XF4) and its human homologue, SMCX, was mapped to proximal Xp (Xp11.1-Xp11.2). Further meiotic mapping in the mouse placed Smcx in the Plp-Pdha1 interval. As Smcx/SMCX have widely expressed homologues on the Y chromosome, they appeared good candidates for genes that escape X-inactivation. In the human we show this to be the case as SMCX is expressed in hamster-human hybrids containing either an active or inactive human X chromosome. Two alleles of Smcx were found to be expressed in T(16;X)16H female mice despite the intact X chromosome being inactive in all cells. This indicates that Smcx is also not subject to X-inactivation and provides the first example of a gene that is expressed from inactive and active X chromosomes in the mouse.},

  abstract = {Alterations in RNA levels are frequently reported in brain of subjects diagnosed with autism, schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric diseases, but it remains unclear whether the underlying molecular pathology involves changes in gene expression, as opposed to alterations in messenger RNA processing. Pre-clinical studies have revealed that stress, drugs, and a variety of other environmental factors lead to changes in RNA levels in brain via epigenetic mechanisms, including modification of histone proteins. A number of site-specific modifications of the nucleosome core histones-including the trimethylated forms of histone H3 lysines K4, K9, and K27-are of particular interest for postmortem research, because these marks differentiate between active and inactive chromatin and seem to remain relatively stable during tissue autolysis. Therefore, histone methylation profiling at promoter regions could provide important clues about mechanisms of gene expression in human brain during development and in disease. Intriguingly, mutations within the genes encoding the H3K9-specific methyltransferase, EHMT1, and the H3K4-specific histone demethylase, JARID1C/SMCX, have been linked to mental retardation and autism, respectively. In addition, the H3K4-specific methyltransferase, MLL1, is essential for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and might be involved in cortical dysfunction of some cases of schizophrenia. Together, these findings emphasize the potential significance of histone lysine methylation for orderly brain development and also as a molecular toolbox to study chromatin function in postmortem tissue.},

Although these disorders are most commonly modeled in mice, we know little regarding the development of learning and memory in this species because most previous studies have been restricted to rats. Therefore, in the present study, we constructed an ontogenetic timeline of contextual fear memory ranging from infancy to adulthood in mice. We found that the ability of mice to form long-term context-shock associations emerged ∼13-14 d of age, which is several days earlier than previously reported for rats. Although the ability to form contextual fear memories remained stable from infancy into adulthood, infant mice had shorter-lasting memories than adolescent and adult mice. Furthermore, we found that mice subjected to fetal alcohol exposure showed a delay in the developmental emergence of contextual fear memory, illustrating the utility of this ontogenetic approach in detecting developmental delays in cognitive function stemming from maladaptive early life experience.},

To advance our understanding of the mechanisms restricting the expression of germline genes, we analyzed their chromatin signature and performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out screen for genes involved in germline gene repression using a Dazl-GFP reporter system in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We show that the repression of germline genes mainly depends on the polycomb complex PRC1.6 and DNA methylation, which function additively in mESCs. Furthermore, we validated novel genes involved in the repression of germline genes and characterized three of them: Usp7, Shfm1 (also known as Sem1) and Erh. Inactivation of Usp7, Shfm1 or Erh led to the upregulation of germline genes, as well as retrotransposons for Shfm1, in mESCs. Mechanistically, USP7 interacts with PRC1.6 components, promotes PRC1.6 stability and presence at germline genes, and facilitates DNA methylation deposition at germline gene promoters for long term repression. Our study provides a global view of the mechanisms and novel factors required for silencing germline genes in embryonic stem cells.},

  abstract = {De novo transcription of DNA is a fundamental requirement for the formation of long-term memory. It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation. In this article, we provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to this transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation.},

SPAG6 and SPAG16 are the homologous in the mice to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PF16 and PF20. Both proteins are associated with the axonemal central apparatus and are essential for ciliary and flagellar motility in mammals. Recent data derived from high-throughput studies revealed expression of these genes in tissues that do not contain motile cilia. However, the distribution of SPAG6 and SPAG16 in ciliated and non-ciliated tissues is not completely understood. In this work, we performed a quantitative analysis of the expression of Spag6 and Spag16 genes in parallel with the immune-localization of the proteins in several tissues of adult mice. Expression of mRNA was higher in the testis and tissues bearing motile cilia than in the other analyzed tissues. Both proteins were present in ciliated and non-ciliated tissues. In the testis, SPAG6 was detected in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and in the sperm flagella whereas SPAG16 was found in spermatocytes and in the sperm flagella. In addition, both proteins were detected in the cytoplasm of cells from the brain, spinal cord, and ovary. A small isoform of SPAG16 was localized in the nucleus of germ cells and some neurons. In a parallel set of experiments, we overexpressed EGFP-SPAG6 in cultured cells and observed that the protein co-localized with a subset of acetylated cytoplasmic microtubules. A role of these proteins stabilizing the cytoplasmic microtubules of eukaryotic cells is discussed.},

Patients with classic RTT appear to develop normally until 6-18 months of age, then gradually lose speech and purposeful hand use, and develop microcephaly, seizures, autism, ataxia, intermittent hyperventilation and stereotypic hand movements. After initial regression, the condition stabilizes and patients usually survive into adulthood. As RTT occurs almost exclusively in females, it has been proposed that RTT is caused by an X-linked dominant mutation with lethality in hemizygous males. Previous exclusion mapping studies using RTT families mapped the locus to Xq28 (refs 6,9,10,11). Using a systematic gene screening approach, we have identified mutations in the gene (MECP2 ) encoding X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the cause of some cases of RTT. MeCP2 selectively binds CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome and mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A (refs 12,13). In 5 of 21 sporadic patients, we found 3 de novo missense mutations in the region encoding the highly conserved methyl-binding domain (MBD) as well as a de novo frameshift and a de novo nonsense mutation, both of which disrupt the transcription repression domain (TRD). In two affected half-sisters of a RTT family, we found segregation of an additional missense mutation not detected in their obligate carrier mother. This suggests that the mother is a germline mosaic for this mutation. Our study reports the first disease-causing mutations in RTT and points to abnormal epigenetic regulation as the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RTT.},

  abstract = {Cdkn1c encodes an embryonic cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor that acts to negatively regulate cell proliferation and, in some tissues, to actively direct differentiation. This gene, which is an imprinted gene expressed only from the maternal allele, lies within a complex region on mouse distal chromosome 7, called the IC2 domain, which contains several other imprinted genes. Studies on mouse embryos suggest a key role for genomic imprinting in regulating embryonic growth and this has led to the proposal that imprinting evolved as a consequence of the mismatched contribution of parental resources in mammals.|In this study, we characterised the phenotype of mice carrying different copy number integrations of a bacterial artificial chromosome spanning Cdkn1c. Excess Cdkn1c resulted in embryonic growth retardation that was dosage-dependent and also responsive to the genetic background. Two-fold expression of Cdkn1c in a subset of tissues caused a 10-30\% reduction in embryonic weight, embryonic lethality and was associated with a reduction in the expression of the potent, non-imprinted embryonic growth factor, Igf1. Conversely, loss of expression of Cdkn1c resulted in embryos that were 11\% heavier with a two-fold increase in Igf1.|We have shown that embryonic growth in mice is exquisitely sensitive to the precise dosage of Cdkn1c. Cdkn1c is a maternally expressed gene and our findings support the prediction of the parental conflict hypothesis that that the paternal genome silences genes that have an inhibitory role in embryonic growth. Within the IC2 imprinted domain, Cdkn1c encodes the major regulator of embryonic growth and we propose that Cdkn1c was the focal point of the selective pressure for imprinting of this domain.},

That study showed that sex differences in behavior, and by extension in the brain, were permanently sexually differentiated by testosterone, a testicular secretion, during an early critical period of development. The study placed the brain together in a class with other major sexually dimorphic tissues (external genitalia and genital tracts), and proposed an integrated hormonal theory of sexual differentiation for all of these non-gonadal tissues. Since 1959, the organizational-activational theory has been amended but survives as a central concept that explains many sex differences in phenotype, in diverse tissues and at all levels of analysis from the molecular to the behavioral. In the last two decades, however, sex differences have been found that are not explained by such gonadal hormonal effects, but rather because of the primary action of genes encoded on the sex chromosomes. To integrate the classic organizational and activational effects with the more recently discovered sex chromosome effects, we propose a unified theory of sexual differentiation that applies to all mammalian tissues.},

For the vast majority of them, though, the sequence elements that regulate their localization are unknown. To identify RNA elements capable of directing transcripts to neurites, we deployed a massively parallel reporter assay that tested the localization regulatory ability of thousands of sequence fragments drawn from endogenous mouse 3′ UTRs. We identified peaks of regulatory activity within several 3′ UTRs and found that sequences derived from these peaks were both necessary and sufficient for RNA localization to neurites in mouse and human neuronal cells. The localization elements were enriched in adenosine and guanosine residues. They were at least tens to hundreds of nucleotides long as shortening of two identified elements led to significantly reduced activity. Using RNA affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we found that the RNA-binding protein Unk was associated with the localization elements. Depletion of Unk in cells reduced the ability of the elements to drive RNAs to neurites, indicating a functional requirement for Unk in their trafficking. These results provide a framework for the unbiased, high-throughput identification of RNA elements and mechanisms that govern transcript localization in neurons.},

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, which regulates the activity of the Gli family of transcriptional activators and repressors, is important for CNS development. Shh signaling involves a cellular structure called the primary cilium. Ashique               et al               . show that the transcription factor Rfx4 serves as a regionally specific regulator of the formation of the primary cilia in the developing CNS. Loss of its activity in mice results in aberrant Shh signaling and Gli3 activity, resulting in defective spinal cord and telencephalon development. Furthermore, the activity of Rfx4 may be regulated by phosphorylation, thus allowing Rfx4 to serve as an upstream regulator of Shh signaling and Gli3 activity in response to developmental signals.                        ,                             Regulatory factor X (Rfx) homologs regulate the transcription of genes necessary for ciliogenesis in invertebrates and vertebrates.

  abstract = {The extent to which histone modifying enzymes contribute to DNA methylation in mammals remains unclear. Previous studies suggested a link between the lysine methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9A and KMT1C) and DNA methylation in the mouse. Here, we used a model of knockout mice to explore the role of EHMT2 in DNA methylation during mouse embryogenesis. The               Ehmt2               gene is expressed in epiblast cells but is dispensable for global DNA methylation in embryogenesis. In contrast, EHMT2 regulates DNA methylation at specific sequences that include CpG-rich promoters of germline-specific genes. These loci are bound by EHMT2 in embryonic cells, are marked by H3K9 dimethylation, and have strongly reduced DNA methylation in               Ehmt2               −/−               embryos. EHMT2 also plays a role in the maintenance of germline-derived DNA methylation at one imprinted locus, the               Slc38a4               gene. Finally, we show that DNA methylation is instrumental for EHMT2-mediated gene silencing in embryogenesis. Our findings identify EHMT2 as a critical factor that facilitates repressive DNA methylation at specific genomic loci during mammalian development.},

  abstract = {Altered synaptic structure and function is a major hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and other intellectual disabilities (IDs), which are therefore classified as synaptopathies. FXS and ASDs, while clinically and genetically distinct, share significant comorbidity, suggesting that there may be a common molecular and/or cellular basis, presumably at the synapse. In this article, we review brain architecture and synaptic pathways that are dysregulated in FXS and ASDs, including spine architecture, signaling in synaptic plasticity, local protein synthesis, (m)RNA modifications, and degradation. mRNA repression is a powerful mechanism for the regulation of synaptic structure and efficacy. We infer that there is no single pathway that explains most of the etiology and discuss new findings and the implications for future work directed at improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of FXS and related ASDs and the design of therapeutic strategies to ameliorate these disorders.},

  abstract = {Specific forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) are modulated by or require increases in cAMP. The various adenylyl cyclase isoforms possess unique regulatory properties, and thus cAMP increases in a given cell type or tissue in response to converging signals are subject to the properties of the adenylyl cyclase isoforms expressed. In most tissues, adenylyl cyclase activity is stimulated by neurotransmitters or hormones via stimulatory G-protein (Gs)-coupled receptors and is inhibited via inhibitory G-protein (Gi)-linked receptors. However, in the hippocampus, stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors potentiates Gs-stimulated cAMP levels. This effect may be associated with the regulatory properties of adenylyl cyclase types 2 and 4 (AC2 and AC4), isoforms that are potentiated by the betagamma subunit of Gi in vitro. Although AC2 has been shown to be stimulated by betagamma in whole cells, reports describing the sensitivity of AC4 to betagamma in vivo have yet to emerge. Our results demonstrate that Gs-mediated stimulation of AC4 is potentiated by betagamma released from activated Gi-coupled receptors in intact human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Furthermore, we show that the AC2 and AC4 proteins are expressed in the mouse hippocampal formation and that they colocalize with MAP2, a dendritic and/or postsynaptic marker. The presence of AC2 and AC4 in the hippocampus and the ability of each of these enzymes to detect coincident activation of Gs- and Gi-coupled receptors suggest that they may play a crucial role in certain forms of synaptic plasticity by coordinating such overlapping synaptic inputs.},

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations.

In turn, environmental factors influence epigenetic mechanisms, such that an epigenetic–environmental link may contribute to the accumulation of cellular damage, susceptibility or resilience to stressors, and variability in the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline. Epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone modifications, alter chromatin structure and the accessibility of DNA. Furthermore, small non-coding RNA, termed microRNA (miRNA) bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) to regulate translation. In this review, we examine key questions concerning epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the expression of genes associated with brain aging and age-related cognitive decline.

  abstract = {Expression of the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) gene is a prerequisite step for dosage compensation in mammals, accomplished by silencing one of the two X chromosomes in normal female diploid cells or all X chromosomes in excess of one in sex chromosome aneuploids. Our previous studies showing that XIST expression does not eventuate the inactivation of X-linked genes in fetal bovine testis had suggested that XIST expression may not be an indicator of X inactivation in this species. In this study, we used a semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach on cultures of bovine cells with varying sex chromosome constitution (XY, XX, XXY and XXX) to test whether the levels of XIST expressed conform to the number of late replicating (inactive) X chromosomes displayed by proliferating cells in these cultures. Expression patterns of four X-linked genes, including hypoxanthine phosphorybosyl transferase (HPRT), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), zinc finger protein locus on the X (ZFX). and 'selected mouse cDNA on the X' (SMCX), in all these cells were also tested. Results showed that XIST expression was significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) in XXX cells compared to XX and XXY cells and that G6PD. HPRT, and SMCX loci are subject to X inactivation. The significantly higher levels of ZFX expressed in XXX cells compared to XX and XXY cells (p {$<$} 0.05) confirmed that this bovine locus, as human ZFX, escapes X inactivation. However, the levels of XIST and ZFX expressed were not proportional to the X chromosome load in these cells suggesting that X-linked loci escaping inactivation may be regulated at transcription (or post-transcription) level by mechanisms that prevent gene-specific product accumulation beyond certain levels in sex chromosome aneuploids.},

  abstract = {A group of post-natal neurodevelopmental disorders collectively referred to as MeCP2 disorders are caused by aberrations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Loss of MeCP2 function causes Rett syndrome (RTT), whereas increased copy number of the gene causes MECP2 duplication or triplication syndromes. MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, however the gene expression changes observed in the hypothalamus of MeCP2 disorder mouse models suggest that MeCP2 can also upregulate gene expression, given that the majority of genes are downregulated upon loss of MeCP2 and upregulated in its presence. To determine if this dual role of MeCP2 extends beyond the hypothalamus, we studied gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of Mecp2-null and MECP2-Tg mice, modeling RTT and MECP2 duplication syndrome, respectively. We found that abnormal MeCP2 dosage causes alterations in the expression of hundreds of genes in the cerebellum. The majority of genes were upregulated in MECP2-Tg mice and downregulated in Mecp2-null mice, consistent with a role for MeCP2 as a modulator that can both increase and decrease gene expression. Interestingly, many of the genes altered in the cerebellum, particularly those increased by the presence of MeCP2 and decreased in its absence, were similarly altered in the hypothalamus. Our data suggest that either gain or loss of MeCP2 results in gene expression changes in multiple brain regions and that some of these changes are global. Further delineation of the expression pattern of MeCP2 target genes throughout the brain might identify subsets of genes that are more amenable to manipulation, and can thus be used to modulate some of the disease phenotypes.},

Although the synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity are well characterized, the associated transcriptional program remains poorly understood. We show that the Kleefstra-syndrome-associated protein EHMT1 plays a critical and cell-autonomous role in synaptic scaling by responding to attenuated neuronal firing or sensory drive. Chronic activity deprivation increased the amount of neuronal dimethylated H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), the catalytic product of EHMT1 and an epigenetic marker for gene repression. Genetic knockdown and pharmacological blockade of EHMT1 or EHMT2 prevented the increase of H3K9me2 and synaptic scaling up. Furthermore, BDNF repression was preceded by EHMT1/2-mediated H3K9me2 deposition at the Bdnf promoter during synaptic scaling up, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that H3K9me2-mediated changes in chromatin structure govern a repressive program that controls synaptic scaling.},

Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28\%) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.},

Here, we investigated whether TAC1- and TAC4-encoded peptides (substance P and hemokinin-1, respectively) and the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) are involved in the modulation of sexual behaviors. Male mice deficient for the NK-1R (TACR1 (-/-)) exhibited decreased exploration of female urine in contrast to C57BL/6 control mice and mice deficient for NK-1R ligands such as TAC1 (-/-), TAC4 (-/-) and the newly generated TAC1 (-/-) /TAC4 (-/-) mice. In comparison to C57BL/6 mice, mounting frequency and duration were decreased in male TACR1 (-/-) mice, while mounting latency was increased. Decreased preference for sexual pheromones was also seen in female TACR1 (-/-) mice. Furthermore, administration of the NK-1R-antagonist L-703,606 decreased investigation of female urine by male C57BL/6 mice, suggesting an involvement of NK-1R in urine sniffing behavior.

ATRX mutations that alter histone binding or chromatin remodeling activities cluster in the PHD finger or the helicase domain respectively. Using engineered mouse embryonic stem cells that exclusively express ATRX protein with mutations in the PHD finger (PHDmut) or helicase domains (K1584R), we examine how specific ATRX mutations affect neurodifferentiation. ATRX PHDmut and K1584R proteins interact with the DAXX histone chaperone but show reduced localization to pericentromeres. Neurodifferentiation is both delayed and compromised in PHDmut and K1584R, and manifest differently from complete ATRX loss. We observe reduced enrichment of PHDmut protein to ATRX targets, while K1584R accumulates at these sites. Interestingly, ATRX mutations have distinct effects on the genome-wide localization of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), with PHDmut and ATRX knockout showing reduced PRC2 binding at polycomb targets and K1584R showing loss at some sites and gains at others. Notably, each mutation associated with unique gene signatures, suggesting distinct pathways leading to impaired neurodifferentiation. Our results indicate that the histone binding and chromatin remodeling functions of ATRX play non-redundant roles in neurodevelopment, and when mutated lead to ATRX syndrome through separate regulatory pathways.},

The intrinsic factors that endow epiblast cells with the competence to respond to germline inductive signals remain unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing across multiple stages of an in vitro PGC-like cells (PGCLC) differentiation system shows that PGCLC genes initially expressed in the naïve pluripotent stage become homogeneously dismantled in germline competent epiblast like-cells (EpiLC). In contrast, the decommissioning of enhancers associated with these germline genes is incomplete. Namely, a subset of these enhancers partly retain H3K4me1, accumulate less heterochromatic marks and remain accessible and responsive to transcriptional activators. Subsequently, as in vitro germline competence is lost, these enhancers get further decommissioned and lose their responsiveness to transcriptional activators. Importantly, using H3K4me1-deficient cells, we show that the loss of this histone modification reduces the germline competence of EpiLC and decreases PGCLC differentiation efficiency. Our work suggests that, although H3K4me1 might not be essential for enhancer function, it can facilitate the (re)activation of enhancers and the establishment of gene expression programs during specific developmental transitions.},

Here, we review recent reports of retrotransposon activity in the brain, and discuss the temporal nature of retrotransposition and its regulation in neural cells in response to stimuli.

  abstract = {Chromatin dysregulation has emerged as a major hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The prevalence of ID and ASD is higher in males compared to females, with unknown mechanisms. Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ), is caused by loss-of-function mutations of lysine demethylase 5C (KDM5C), a histone H3K4 demethylase gene. KDM5C escapes X-inactivation, thereby presenting at a higher level in females. Initially, MRXSCJ was exclusively reported in males, while it is increasingly evident that females with heterozygous KDM5C mutations can show cognitive deficits. The mouse model of MRXSCJ, male Kdm5c-hemizygous knockout animals, recapitulates key features of human male patients. However, the behavioral and molecular traits of Kdm5c-heterozygous female mice remain incompletely characterized. Here, we report that gene expression and behavioral abnormalities are readily detectable in Kdm5c-heterozygous female mice, demonstrating the requirement for a higher KDM5C dose in females. Furthermore, we found both shared and sex-specific consequences of a reduced KDM5C dose in social behavior, gene expression, and genetic interaction with the counteracting enzyme KMT2A. These observations provide an essential insight into the sex-biased manifestation of neurodevelopmental disorders and sex chromosome evolution.},

  abstract = {Mutations in numerous chromatin regulators cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with unknown mechanisms. Understandably, most research has focused on how chromatin regulators control gene expression that is directly relevant to brain development and function, such as synaptic genes. However, some NDD models surprisingly show ectopic expression of germline genes in the brain. These germline genes are usually expressed only in the primordial germ cells, testis, and ovaries for germ cell development and sexual reproduction. Such ectopic germline gene expression has been reported in several NDDs, including immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies syndrome 1; Kleefstra syndrome 1; MeCP2 duplication syndrome; and mental retardation, X-linked syndromic, Claes-Jensen type. The responsible genes, DNMT3B, G9A/GLP, MECP2, and KDM5C, all encode chromatin regulators for gene silencing. These mutations may therefore lead to germline gene derepression and, in turn, a severe identity crisis of brain cells-potentially interfering with normal brain development. Thus, the ectopic expression of germline genes is a unique hallmark defining this NDD subset and further implicates the importance of germline gene silencing during brain development. The functional impact of germline gene expression on brain development, however, remains undetermined. This perspective article explores how this apparent soma-to-germline transformation arises and how it may interfere with neurodevelopment through genomic instability and impaired sensory cilium formation. Furthermore, we also discuss how to test these hypotheses experimentally to ultimately determine the contribution of ectopic germline transcripts to chromatin-linked NDDs.},

We optimized methylated DNA immunoprecipitation for low numbers of cells and profiled DNA methylation during early development of the mouse embryonic lineage in vivo. We observed a major epigenetic switch during implantation at the transition from the blastocyst to the postimplantation epiblast. During this period, DNA methylation is primarily targeted to repress the germline expression program. DNA methylation in the epiblast is also targeted to promoters of lineage-specific genes such as hematopoietic genes, which are subsequently demethylated during terminal differentiation. De novo methylation during early embryogenesis is catalyzed by Dnmt3b, and absence of DNA methylation leads to ectopic gene activation in the embryo. Finally, we identify nonimprinted genes that inherit promoter DNA methylation from parental gametes, suggesting that escape of post-fertilization DNA methylation reprogramming is prevalent in the mouse genome.},

  abstract = {Spatial memory depends on the hippocampus, which is particularly vulnerable to aging. This vulnerability has implications for the impairment of navigation capacities in older people, who may show a marked drop in performance of spatial tasks with advancing age. Contemporary understanding of long-term memory formation relies on molecular mechanisms underlying long-term synaptic plasticity. With memory acquisition, activity-dependent changes occurring in synapses initiate multiple signal transduction pathways enhancing protein turnover. This enhancement facilitates de novo synthesis of plasticity related proteins, crucial factors for establishing persistent long-term synaptic plasticity and forming memory engrams. Extensive studies have been performed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of memory traces formation; however, the identity of plasticity related proteins is still evasive. In this study, we investigated protein turnover in mouse hippocampus during long-term spatial memory formation using the reference memory version of radial arm maze (RAM) paradigm. We identified 1592 proteins, which exhibited a complex picture of expression changes during spatial memory formation. Variable linear decomposition reduced significantly data dimensionality and enriched three principal factors responsible for variance of memory-related protein levels at (1) the initial phase of memory acquisition (165 proteins), (2) during the steep learning improvement (148 proteins), and (3) the final phase of the learning curve (123 proteins). Gene ontology and signaling pathways analysis revealed a clear correlation between memory improvement and learning phase-curbed expression profiles of proteins belonging to specific functional categories. We found differential enrichment of (1) neurotrophic factors signaling pathways, proteins regulating synaptic transmission, and actin microfilament during the first day of the learning curve; (2) transcription and translation machinery, protein trafficking, enhancement of metabolic activity, and Wnt signaling pathway during the steep phase of memory formation; and (3) cytoskeleton organization proteins. Taken together, this study clearly demonstrates dynamic assembly and disassembly of protein-protein interaction networks depending on the stage of memory formation engrams.},

GAL modulates the release of acetylcholine and, therefore, may depress this neurotransmitter in surviving cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons in AD. The aim of this study was to identify putative synaptic contacts between GAL immunoreactive processes and CBF neurons and evaluate whether these processes hypertrophy in AD patients. We observed by confocal laser microscopy a hyperinnervation of GAL-containing fibers in both AD and Parkinson's disease patients with concurrent AD (PD/AD). Galaninergic fibers were often seen in direct apposition to remaining CBF neurons and enwrapped cholinergic cell soma and dendrites. Our results demonstrate that GAL-containing fibers are in direct apposition to CBF neurons in normal-aged humans and that this phenotype is enhanced in AD and PD/AD, suggesting that direct synaptic contacts occur between GAL-containing fibers and CBF neurons. Because GAL can modulate acetylcholine release from cholinergic neurons, hyperinnervation of GAL fibers in AD and PD/AD patients may further decrease release of acetylcholine from remaining CBF neurons. We propose that therapies based solely on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be insufficient to effectively increase cortical levels of acetylcholine.},

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure. PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency, but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys 27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Our results indicate that dynamic repression of developmental pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development.},

  abstract = {Nearly 20\% of genes located on the X chromosome are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) due to their expression and role in brain functioning. Given their location, several of these genes are either subject to or can escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). The degree to which genes are subject to XCI can influence the NDD phenotype between males and females. We provide a general review of X-linked NDD genes in the context of XCI and detailed discussion of the sex-based differences related to MECP2 and FMR1, two common X-linked causes of NDD that are subject to XCI. Understanding the effects of XCI on phenotypic expression of NDD genes may guide the development of stratification biomarkers in X-linked disorders.},

It has remained unknown whether not only lesion-type-specific, but overall repair capacities could be improved. Here we show that the DREAM repressor complex curbs the DNA-repair capacities in somatic tissues of               Caenorhabditis elegans               . Mutations in the DREAM complex induce germline-like expression patterns of multiple mechanisms of DNA repair in the soma. Consequently, DREAM mutants confer resistance to a wide range of DNA-damage types during development and aging. Similarly, inhibition of the DREAM complex in human cells boosts DNA-repair gene expression and resistance to distinct DNA-damage types. DREAM inhibition leads to decreased DNA damage and prevents photoreceptor loss in progeroid               Ercc1               −/−               mice. We show that the DREAM complex transcriptionally represses essentially all DNA-repair systems and thus operates as a highly conserved master regulator of the somatic limitation of DNA-repair capacities.},

Antisera raised against the SMCp protein were used to show that the protein is present in the cell nucleus. Immunofluorescence showed that although UBCv1 is present in the nucleus in most cells, in some cells it is in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The interaction and co-localisation of UBCv1 with SMCp suggest that SMCp may be a substrate in vivo for the enzyme.},

Infusion of hCG into either the lateral ventricle or the dorsal hippocampus caused significant memory impairments in ovariectomized estradiol-treated females. Consistent with this, infusion of the LH antagonist dg-hCG into the dorsal hippocampus caused an amelioration of memory deficits in ovariectomized females. Furthermore, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist Antide, failed to act in the hippocampus to affect memory. These findings demonstrate a significant role for LH action in the dorsal hippocampus in spatial memory dysfunction.},

To date, 35 pathogenic variants have been reported in the lysine specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C) gene. KDM5C variants are one of the major causes of moderate to severe XLID. Affected males present with short stature, distinctive facial features, behavioral disorders, epilepsy, and spasticity. For most of these variants, related female carriers have been reported, but phenotypic descriptions were poor. Here, we present clinical and molecular features of 19 females carrying 10 novel heterozygous variants affecting KDM5C function, including five probands with de novo variants. Four heterozygous females were asymptomatic. All affected individuals presented with learning disabilities or ID (mostly moderate), and four also had a language impairment mainly affecting expression. Behavioral disturbances were frequent, and endocrine disorders were more frequent in females. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence of the role of KDM5C in ID in females highlighting the increasing implication of XLID genes in females, even in sporadic affected individuals. Disease expression of XLID in females should be taken into consideration for genetic counseling.},

Additionally, inactive X expression levels differed between extraembryonic and embryonic tissues and among different tissues from newborn and adult mice. Imprinted extraembryonic tissue had the lowest levels of inactive X Smcx expression, whereas the highest levels were in heart. These data suggest that the chromosomal basis of X inactivation differs among tissues, perhaps reflecting differences in the timing or regulation of inactivation in these cell lineages.},

  abstract = {Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are 2 clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple anomalies and mental retardation. They are only discussed together because they share a similar and uncommon genetic basis: they involve genes that are located in the same region in the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions through inactivation of 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternally derived copy of genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in proximal 15q are normally silent, and a paternally derived copy of 1 gene for Angelman syndrome in 15q is normally silent. For both disorders, when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is missing, abnormality results. Since the genes for these 2 disorders are located very close together, and since the center involved in inactivating the genes involved in imprinting may be the same, both these disorders usually result from the same chromosomal deletion; which disorder results depends on the parent of origin of the chromosome 15 that becomes deleted. Both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome can also occur as a result of having both members of the chromosome 15 pair derived from 1 parent, a condition known as uniparental disomy. Both can also result from a structural abnormality of the imprinting center, known as an imprinting mutation. In addition, Angelman syndrome can be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it; a comparable cause is not present in Prader-Willi syndrome since it results from abnormality in more than 1 gene. Finally, despite the complexity of possible causes, all but the single gene mutation of the Angelman syndrome gene can be detected through methylation-sensitive DNA probes, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes for these 2 disorders are imprinted. This unusual property of specific areas of the DNA holds promise for future treatment of these and other disorders related to imprinting through reversal of the imprinting process.},

  abstract = {:               The discovery of the mysterious dark matter of the genome expands our understanding of modern biology. Beyond the genome, the epigenome reveals a hitherto unknown path of key biological and functional gene control activities. Extraordinary character-P element wimpy testis-induced (PiWi)-interacting RNA (piRNA) is a type of small non-coding RNA that acts as a defender by silencing nucleic and structural invaders. PiWi proteins and piRNAs can be found in both reproductive and somatic cells, though germ line richness has been partially unravelled. The primary function is to suppress invading DNA sequences known as Transpose of Elements (TEs) that move within genomic DNA and downstream target genes via Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS) and Post-Translational Gene Silencing (PTGS). Germline piRNAs preserve genomic integrity, stability, sternness, and influence imprinting expression. The novel roles of somatic tissue-specific piRNAs have surprised researchers. In metazoans, including humans, piRNA regulates neurodevelopmental processes. The PiWi pathway regulates neural heterogeneity, neurogenesis, neural plasticity, and transgenerational inheritance of adaptive and long-term memory. Dysregulated piRNA causes neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric illness. A faulty piRNA signature results in inadvertent gene activation via TE activation, incorrect epigenetic tags on DNA, and/or histones. Imprinting expression is influenced by germline piRNAs, which maintain genomic integrity, stability, and sternness. New roles for piRNAs specific to somatic tissues have been discovered. Metazoans, including humans, are regulated by piRNA. In addition, the PiWi pathway regulates neuronal heterogeneity and neurogenesis as well as brain plasticity and transgenerational inheritance of adaptive and long-term memory. When piRNA is dysregulated, it can lead to neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses. Inappropriate gene activation or inactivation is caused by aberrant piRNA signatures, TE activation, inappropriate epigenetic marks on DNA, and/or histones. Defective piRNA regulation causes abnormal brain development and neurodegenerative aetiology, which promotes life-threatening disorders. Exemplification of exciting roles of piRNA is still in its early stages, so future research may expand on these observations using novel techniques and launch them as potential biomarkers for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we summarised the potential gene molecular role of piRNAs in regulating neurobiology and serving as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for life-threatening disease.},

Using population-based health registries, we conducted a cohort study of all liveborn singleton boys in Denmark during 1979-2008. Boys with a diagnosis of cryptorchidism were categorized into the exposed cohort and the other boys into the unexposed comparison cohort. The outcomes were diagnoses of any neurodevelopmental disorders and their subtypes. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs), taking into consideration several potential confounders. Among 884,083 male infants, 27,505 received a diagnosis of cryptorchidism during follow-up. Boys with cryptorchidism were more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disability (HR = 1.77; 95\%confidence interval [CI]:1.59,1.97), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (HR = 1.24; 95\% CI:1.13,1.35), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (HR = 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.08,1.26), anxiety (HR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01,1.17), and other behavioral/emotional disorders (HR = 1.16; 95\% CI: 1.08,1.26) compared to boys without cryptorchidism. The observed risks of intellectual disability, ASD, and ADHD were increased further in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Except for anxiety, cryptorchid boys had higher risks of neurodevelopmental disorders than their non-cryptorchid full brothers. The observed increased risks were similar among boys who underwent orchiopexy, as well as among those with shorter waiting times for this surgery. Cryptorchidism may be associated with increased risks of intellectual disability, ASD, ADHD, and other behavioral/emotional disorders. Cryptorchidism and neurodevelopmental disorders may have shared genetic or in-utero/early postnatal risk factors, which need to be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents of anogenital tract dysplasia and cancers and a fraction of head and neck cancers. The HR HPV E6 oncoprotein possesses canonical oncogenic functions, such as p53 degradation and telomerase activation. It is also capable of stimulating expression of several oncogenes, but the molecular mechanism underlying these events is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that HPV16 E6 physically interacts with histone H3K4 demethylase KDM5C, resulting in its degradation in an E3 ligase E6AP- and proteasome-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that HPV16-positive cancer cell lines exhibited lower KDM5C protein levels than HPV-negative cancer cell lines. Restoration of KDM5C significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of CaSki cells, an HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line. Whole genome ChIP-seq and RNA-seq results revealed that CaSki cells contained super-enhancers in the proto-oncogenes EGFR and c-MET. Ectopic KDM5C dampened these super-enhancers and reduced the expression of proto-oncogenes. This effect was likely mediated by modulating H3K4me3/H3K4me1 dynamics and decreasing bidirectional enhancer RNA transcription. Depletion of KDM5C or HPV16 E6 expression activated these two super-enhancers. These results illuminate a pivotal relationship between the oncogenic E6 proteins expressed by HR HPV isotypes and epigenetic activation of super-enhancers in the genome that drive expression of key oncogenes like EGFR and c-MET.             Significance: This study suggests a novel explanation for why infections with certain HPV isotypes are associated with elevated cancer risk by identifying an epigenetic mechanism through which E6 proteins expressed by those isotypes can drive expression of key oncogenes.

  abstract = {Full-grown oocytes are transcriptionally silent and must stably maintain the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) needed for oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development. However, where and how mammalian oocytes store maternal mRNAs is unclear. Here, we report that mammalian oocytes accumulate mRNAs in a mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain (MARDO). MARDO assembly around mitochondria was promoted by the RNA-binding protein ZAR1 and directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. MARDO foci coalesced into hydrogel-like matrices that clustered mitochondria. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO were translationally repressed. Loss of ZAR1 disrupted the MARDO, dispersed mitochondria, and caused a premature loss of MARDO-localized mRNAs. Thus, a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment controls mitochondrial distribution and regulates maternal mRNA storage, translation, and decay to ensure fertility in mammals.           ,              Oocytes store mRNAs around mitochondria                            Mammalian oocytes stop transcribing DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) during the final stages of their development. The oocyte’s meiotic divisions and early embryo development occur in the absence of transcription and rely instead on maternal mRNAs that are stored in the oocyte. However, where and how mammalian oocytes store mRNAs has remained elusive. Cheng               et al               . discovered that mammalian oocytes, including those in humans, store maternal mRNAs around the mitochondria in a membraneless compartment with hydrogel-like properties. The RNA-binding protein ZAR1 drives the assembly of this compartment, which clusters the mitochondria and protects the mRNAs against degradation. —SMH                        ,              A membraneless compartment clusters mitochondria and stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes of various mammalian species.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Mammalian oocytes accumulate a large number of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through active transcription as they grow. Transcription ceases during the final stages of oocyte growth and only resumes when the embryonic genome is activated after fertilization. During this period, the oocyte and the embryo can only use the stored mRNAs to synthesize new proteins. Proper storage of maternal mRNAs is thus critical for the maturation of oocytes into fertilizable eggs through meiosis and for early embryonic development after fertilization. However, where and how maternal mRNAs are stored in mammalian oocytes, including human oocytes, has remained elusive.                                         RATIONALE                                RNAs are often stored in membraneless compartments that form by spontaneous phase separation of proteins and/or nucleic acids. Previous studies identified different types of membraneless compartments that store mRNAs in non-mammalian oocytes, such as P granules in                 Caenorhabditis elegans                 and Polar granules in                 Drosophila                 . We thus set out to identify potential RNA storage compartments in mammalian oocytes.                                                        RESULTS               We analyzed the localization of RNA-binding proteins that were highly expressed in mouse oocytes. We found that the RNA-binding proteins ZAR1, YBX2, DDX6, LSM14B, and 4E-T (EIF4ENIF1) co-localized with mitochondria, forming clusters throughout the cytoplasm. By contrast, they did not co-localize with the Golgi apparatus, recycling endosomes, or lysosomes, and only partially co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, we stained mRNAs using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and found that they were stored in this mitochondria-associated domain. This domain was also present in oocytes of other mammalian species, including humans. Because this domain was distinct from any known RNA-containing compartment, we named it mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain, or MARDO for short.                                MARDO assembly around mitochondria was directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. The MARDO gradually appeared as oocytes grew and became most prominent in full-grown oocytes, the mitochondria of which are also the most active. Among the MARDO-localized RNA-binding proteins, ZAR1 played a major role in the assembly of the MARDO. ZAR1, but not other RNA-binding proteins, promoted the coalescence of MARDO foci into hydrogel-like matrices when overexpressed. MARDO coalescence drove the aggregation of mitochondria into giant clusters. Through a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we found that the unstructured N-terminal domain of ZAR1 was essential for MARDO assembly and its association with mitochondria. We depleted ZAR1 by gene knockout, RNA interference, and Trim-Away and found that both MARDO formation and mitochondrial clustering were impaired. MARDO formation and mitochondrial clustering were restored by expressing ZAR1 in                 Zar1                 -knockout oocytes. These results confirmed that ZAR1 is essential for MARDO assembly and mitochondrial clustering. Furthermore, live-cell imaging analyses showed that loss of ZAR1 caused severe defects in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis during oocyte meiotic maturation.                              The MARDO stored translationally repressed mRNAs, some of which are known to become translationally activated during the maturation of oocytes into fertilizable eggs or after fertilization. Loss of ZAR1 not only disrupted the MARDO, but also caused a premature loss of MARDO-localized mRNAs. Maternal mRNAs need to be progressively degraded and replaced by mRNAs transcribed from the embryonic genome to ensure proper embryonic development. The MARDO dissolved during the transition from meiosis I to meiosis II because of proteasomal degradation of ZAR1, which was essential for the timely degradation of maternal mRNAs.                                         CONCLUSION               In this study, we identified the MARDO, a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment that stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes of various mammalian species, including humans. Our data reveal how the MARDO coordinates maternal mRNA storage, translation, and degradation to ensure fertility in mammals. The RNA-binding protein ZAR1 promotes MARDO assembly and coalescence into clusters. The MARDO stores translationally repressed mRNAs, some of which are translated during later stages of development. Proteasomal degradation of ZAR1 drives MARDO dissolution in mature eggs to ensure the timely degradation of maternal mRNAs.               Our data also reveal physical and functional interactions between the membraneless MARDO and membrane-bound mitochondria, both of which are maternally contributed compounds that accumulate during oocyte growth.

However, the factors that explain the differences among the deepest branches have remained unknown. We tested whether multicellularity and sexual reproduction might explain these patterns, since the most species-rich groups share these traits. We found that groups with multicellularity and sexual reproduction have accelerated rates of species proliferation (diversification), and that multicellularity has a stronger effect than sexual reproduction. Patterns of species richness among clades are then strongly related to these differences in diversification rates. Taken together, these results help explain patterns of biodiversity among groups of organisms at the very broadest scales. They may also help explain the mysterious preponderance of sexual reproduction among species (the ‘paradox of sex’) by showing that organisms with sexual reproduction proliferate more rapidly.},

We show that mouse Lin41 (mLin41) is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and its expression declines during neural differentiation. Loss of mLin41 function in mice causes reduced proliferation and premature differentiation of embryonic neural progenitor cells. mLin41 was recently implicated as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key effector of the microRNA pathway. However, our mechanistic studies of neural progenitor cells indicate mLin41 is not required for AGO2 ubiquitination or stability. Instead, mLin41-deficient neural progenitors exhibit hyposensitivity for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. We show that mLin41 promotes FGF signaling by directly binding to and enhancing the stability of Shc SH2-binding protein 1 (SHCBP1) and that SHCBP1 is an important component of FGF signaling in neural progenitor cells. Thus, mLin41 acts as a temporal regulator to promote neural progenitor cell maintenance, not via the regulation of AGO2 stability, but through FGF signaling.},

Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with transcriptional regulation, in neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei collected from prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 11 individuals ranging in age from 0.5 to 69 years. Massively parallel sequencing identified 12,732–19,704 H3K4me3 enriched regions (peaks), the majority located proximal to (within 2 kb of) the transcription start site (TSS) of annotated genes. These included peaks shared by neurons in comparison with three control (lymphocyte) cell types, as well as peaks specific to individual subjects. We identified 6,213 genes that show highly enriched H3K4me3 in neurons versus control. At least 1,370 loci, including annotated genes and novel transcripts, were selectively tagged with H3K4me3 in neuronal but not in nonneuronal PFC chromatin. Our results reveal age-correlated neuronal epigenome reorganization, including decreased H3K4me3 at approximately 600 genes (many function in developmental processes) during the first year after birth. In comparison, the epigenome of aging ({$>$}60 years) PFC neurons showed less extensive changes, including increased H3K4me3 at 100 genes. These findings demonstrate that H3K4me3 in human PFC is highly regulated in a cell type- and subject-specific manner and highlight the importance of early childhood for developmentally regulated chromatin remodeling in prefrontal neurons.},

It has become increasingly apparent that the misregulation of histone modification, which is caused by the deregulation of factors that mediate the modification installation, removal and/or interpretation, actively contributes to human cancer. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the interpretation of certain histone methylations by plant homeodomain finger-containing proteins, and how misreading, miswriting and mis-erasing of histone methylation marks can be associated with oncogenesis and progression. These observations provide us with a greater mechanistic understanding of epigenetic alterations in human cancers and might also help direct new therapeutic interventions in the future.},

Here, we investigate the spatial distribution and regulation of mRNAs encoding these membrane and secretory proteins (termed “secretome” mRNAs) through live cell, single molecule tracking to directly monitor the position and translation states of secretome mRNAs on ER and their relationship to other organelles. Notably, translation of secretome mRNAs occurred preferentially near lysosomes on ER marked by the ER junction-associated protein, Lunapark. Knockdown of Lunapark reduced the extent of secretome mRNA translation without affecting translation of other mRNAs. Less secretome mRNA translation also occurred when lysosome function was perturbed by raising lysosomal pH or inhibiting lysosomal proteases. Secretome mRNA translation near lysosomes was enhanced during amino acid deprivation. Addition of the integrated stress response inhibitor, ISRIB, reversed the translation inhibition seen in Lunapark knockdown cells, implying an eIF2 dependency. Altogether, these findings uncover a novel coordination between ER and lysosomes, in which local release of amino acids and other factors from ER-associated lysosomes patterns and regulates translation of mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins.},

Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 protein interacts with dynamin and specific isoforms of endophilin to enhance receptor endocytosis. Arc/Arg3.1 selectively modulates trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in neurons by accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression. The Arc/Arg3.1-endocytosis pathway appears to regulate basal AMPAR levels since Arc/Arg3.1 KO neurons exhibit markedly reduced endocytosis and increased steady-state surface levels.

Consistent with a role for the JARID1 Drosophila homolog Lid in regulating expression of homeotic genes during development, we show that RBP2 is displaced from Hox genes during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation correlating with an increase of their H3K4me3 levels and expression. Furthermore, we show that mutation or RNAi depletion of the C. elegans JARID1 homolog rbr-2 leads to increased levels of H3K4me3 during larval development and defects in vulva formation. Taken together, these results suggest that H3K4me3/me2 demethylation regulated by the JARID1 family plays an important role during development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Females and males often have markedly different mortality rates and life spans, but it is unclear why these forms of sexual dimorphism evolve. The unguarded X hypothesis contends that dimorphic life spans arise from sex differences in X or Z chromosome copy number (i.e., one copy in the “heterogametic” sex; two copies in the “homogametic” sex), which leads to a disproportionate expression of deleterious mutations by the heterogametic sex (e.g., mammalian males; avian females). Although data on adult sex ratios and sex-specific longevity are consistent with predictions of the unguarded X hypothesis, direct experimental evidence remains scant, and alternative explanations are difficult to rule out. Using a simple population genetic model, we show that the unguarded X effect on sex differential mortality is a function of several reasonably well-studied evolutionary parameters, including the proportion of the genome that is sex linked, the genomic deleterious mutation rate, the mean dominance of deleterious mutations, the relative rates of mutation and strengths of selection in each sex, and the average effect of mutations on survival and longevity relative to their effects on fitness. We review published estimates of these parameters, parameterize our model with them, and show that unguarded X effects are too small to explain observed sex differences in life span across species. For example, sex differences in mean life span are known to often exceed 20\% (e.g., in mammals), whereas our parameterized models predict unguarded X effects of a few percent (e.g., 1–3\% in Drosophila and mammals). Indeed, these predicted unguarded X effects fall below statistical thresholds of detectability in most experiments, potentially explaining why direct tests of the hypothesis have generated little support for it. Our results suggest that evolution of sexually dimorphic life spans is predominantly attributable to other mechanisms, potentially including “toxic Y” effects and sexual dimorphism for optimal investment in survival versus reproduction.             Impact Summary             Females and males are dimorphic for a wide range of traits, including the average lengths of their life spans. Sex differences in life span are both conspicuous and variable among species. For example, in mammals, females live ∼20\% longer than males (on average), whereas in birds, males live ∼10\% longer than females. One leading explanation for these patterns—the unguarded X hypothesis—argues that sex differences in life span emerge from the distinct sex chromosomes that females and males inherit. For many species, one sex (e.g., female mammals; male birds) carries two copies of each X-linked gene, whereas the other carries one. Because harmful mutations are partially recessive, the sex with only one copy of the X is more prone to expressing them, and that sex should therefore have a shorter average life span. This prediction of the unguarded X hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with observations of sex-ratio bias in adults and sexual dimorphism for longevity (e.g., mammalian males have one copy of the X and have shorter lives than females). However, there are other possible explanations for these patterns, making it unclear how much the unguarded X explains species diversity for sex-specific longevity. We developed a mathematical model for the contribution of unguarded X effects to sex differences in survival and life span, and used data on mutation rates and their effects on survival and fitness to quantify the importance of the unguarded X across species. The model, when combined with current data, suggests that the unguarded X hypothesis cannot explain the conspicuous sex differences in life span that are commonly reported in animal species, particularly vertebrates. Our results suggest that the unguarded X is an unlikely general explanation for the evolution of sexually dimorphic life spans, which gives weight to alternative mechanisms, including “toxic Y” effects and sex differential selection via trade-offs between survival and reproduction.},

Functional and ultrastructural investigations have shown that adenylyl cyclases are intimately associated with sites of calcium ion entry into the cell. Oscillations in cellular cyclic AMP levels are predicted to arise because of feedback inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Ca2+. Such findings inextricably intertwine cellular signalling by cAMP and internal Ca2+ and extend the known regulatory modes available to cAMP.},

As a result, several mechanisms appear to have emerged during eukaryotic evolution to suppress TE activity. However, TEs are ubiquitous and account for a prominent fraction of most eukaryotic genomes. We argue that the evolutionary success of TEs cannot be explained solely by evasion from host control mechanisms. Rather, some TEs have evolved commensal and even mutualistic strategies that mitigate the cost of their propagation. These coevolutionary processes promote the emergence of complex cellular activities, which in turn pave the way for cooption of TE sequences for organismal function.},

Cilia are important for communicating with the cell’s immediate environment: signal reception and transduction to/from the ciliated cell. Deregulation of ciliary signaling can lead to ciliopathies and certain neurodevelopmental disorders. In the developing brain cilia play well-documented roles for the expansion of the neural progenitor cell pool, while information about the roles of cilia during post-mitotic neuron differentiation and maturation is scarce.                                         Results                                We employed ciliated Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells in time course experiments to assess the impact of ciliary signaling on neuron differentiation. By comparing ciliated and non-ciliated neuronal precursor cells and neurons in wild type and in RFX2 -/- mutant neurons with altered cilia, we discovered an early-differentiation “ciliary time window” during which transient cilia promote axon outgrowth, branching and arborization. Experiments in neurons with                 IFT88                 and                 IFT172                 ciliary gene knockdowns, leading to shorter cilia, confirm these results. Cilia promote neuron differentiation by tipping WNT signaling toward the non-canonical pathway, in turn activating WNT pathway output genes implicated in cyto-architectural changes.                                                        Conclusions               We provide a mechanistic entry point into when and how ciliary signaling coordinates, promotes and translates into anatomical changes. We hypothesize that ciliary alterations causing neuron differentiation defects may result in “mild” impairments of brain development, possibly underpinning certain aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by dementia and premature death. Early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease is caused in part by pathogenic variants in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and alternative splicing of these two genes has been implicated in both familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we leveraged targeted isoform-sequencing to characterize thousands of complete PSEN1 and PSEN2 transcripts in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, familial Alzheimer’s disease (carrying PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants), and controls. Our results reveal alternative splicing patterns of PSEN2 specific to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, including a human-specific cryptic exon present in intron 9 of PSEN2 as well as a 77 bp intron retention product before exon 6 that are both significantly elevated in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease samples, alongside a significantly lower percentage of canonical full-length PSEN2 transcripts versus familial Alzheimer’s disease samples and controls. Both alternatively spliced products are predicted to generate a prematurely truncated PSEN2 protein and were corroborated in an independent cerebellum RNA-sequencing dataset. In addition, our data in PSEN variant carriers is consistent with the hypothesis that PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants need to produce full-length but variant proteins to contribute to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, although intriguingly there were far fewer full-length transcripts carrying pathogenic alleles versus wild-type alleles in PSEN2 variant carriers. Finally, we identify frequent RNA editing at Alu elements present in an extended 3′ untranslated region in PSEN2. Overall, this work expands the understanding of PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants in Alzheimer’s disease, shows that transcript differences in PSEN2 may play a role in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, and suggests novel mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {There are more than 55,000 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) in the human genome, notable for both their striking polymorphism and mutability. Despite their role in human evolution and genomic variation, they have yet to be studied collectively and in detail, partially owing to their large size, variability, and predominant location in noncoding regions. Here, we examine 467 VNTRs that are human-specific expansions, unique to one location in the genome, and not associated with retrotransposons. We leverage publicly available long-read genomes, including from the Human Genome Structural Variant Consortium, to ascertain the exact nucleotide composition of these VNTRs and compare their composition of alleles. We then confirm repeat unit composition in more than 3000 short-read samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. Our analysis reveals that these VNTRs contain highly structured repeat motif organization, modified by frequent deletion and duplication events. Although overall VNTR compositions tend to remain similar between 1000 Genomes Project superpopulations, we describe a notable exception with substantial differences in repeat composition (in               PCBP3               ), as well as several VNTRs that are significantly different in length between superpopulations (in               ART1, PROP1, DYNC2I1               , and               LOC102723906               ). We also observe that most of these VNTRs are expanded in archaic human genomes, yet remain stable in length between single generations. Collectively, our findings indicate that repeat motif variability, repeat composition, and repeat length are all informative modalities to consider when characterizing VNTRs and their contribution to genomic variation.},

Functional studies have described essential roles for mouse LIN41 in embryonic stem cells, cellular reprogramming and the timing of embryonic neurogenesis. We have used a new gene trap mouse line deficient in Lin41 to characterize Lin41 expression during embryonic development and in the postnatal central nervous system (CNS). In the embryo, Lin41 is required for embryonic viability and neural tube closure. Nevertheless, neurosphere assays suggest that Lin41 is not required for adult neurogenesis. Instead, we show that Lin41 promoter activity and protein expression in the postnatal CNS is restricted to ependymal cells lining the walls of the four ventricles. We use ependymal cell culture to confirm reestablishment of Lin41 expression during differentiation of ependymal progenitors to post-mitotic cells possessing motile cilia. Our results reveal that terminally differentiated ependymal cells express Lin41, a gene to date associated with self-renewing stem cells.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gain a better understanding of sex-specific differences in individuals with global developmental delay (GDD), with a focus on phenotypes and genotypes. METHODS: Using the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) dataset, we extracted phenotypic information from 6,588 individuals with GDD and then identified statistically significant variations in phenotypes and genotypes based on sex. We compared genes with pathogenic variants between sex and then performed gene network and molecular function enrichment analysis and gene expression profiling between sex. Finally, we contrasted individuals with autism as an associated condition. RESULTS: We identified significantly differentially expressed phenotypes in males vs. females individuals with GDD. Autism and macrocephaly were significantly more common in males whereas microcephaly and stereotypies were more common in females. Importantly, 66\% of GDD genes with pathogenic variants overlapped between both sexes. In the cohort, males presented with only slightly increased X-linked genes (9\% vs. 8\%, respectively). Individuals from both sexes harbored a similar number of pathogenic variants overall (3) but females presented with a significantly higher load for GDD genes with high intolerance to loss of function. Sex difference in gene expression correlated with genes identified in a sex specific manner. While we identified sex-specific GDD gene mutations, their pathways overlapped. Interestingly, individuals with GDD but also co-morbid autism phenotypes, we observed distinct mutation load, pathways and phenotypic presentation. CONCLUSION: Our study shows for the first time that males and females with GDD present with significantly different phenotypes. Moreover, while most GDD genes overlapped, some genes were found uniquely in each sex. Surprisingly they shared similar molecular functions. Sorting genes by predicted tolerance to loss of function (pLI) led to identifying an increased mutation load in females with GDD, suggesting potentially a tolerance to GDD genes of higher pLI compared to overall GDD genes. Finally, we show that considering associated conditions (for instance autism) may influence the genomic underpinning found in individuals with GDD and highlight the importance of comprehensive phenotyping.},

Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor E2F6, a member of the polycomb repressive complex 1.6 (PRC1.6), is critical to target and initiate epigenetic silencing at germline genes in early embryogenesis. Genome-wide, E2F6 binds preferentially to CpG islands in embryonic cells. E2F6 cooperates with MGA to silence a subgroup of germline genes in mouse embryonic stem cells and in embryos, a function that critically depends on the E2F6 marked box domain. Inactivation of               E2f6               leads to a failure to deposit CpG island DNA methylation at these genes during implantation. Furthermore, E2F6 is required to initiate epigenetic silencing in early embryonic cells but becomes dispensable for the maintenance in differentiated cells. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms of epigenetic targeting of germline genes and provide a paradigm for how transient repression signals by DNA-binding factors in early embryonic cells are translated into long-term epigenetic silencing during mouse development.},

  abstract = {The tail of replication-dependent histone H3.1 varies from that of replication-independent H3.3 at the amino acid located at position 31 in plants and animals, but no function has been assigned to this residue to demonstrate a unique and conserved role for H3.1 during replication. We found that TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which rescues broken replication forks, specifically interacts with H3.1 via recognition of alanine 31 by its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Our results indicate that genomic instability in the absence of ATXR5/ATXR6-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation in plants depends on H3.1, TSK, and DNA polymerase theta (Pol θ). This work reveals an H3.1-specific function during replication and a common strategy used in multicellular eukaryotes for regulating post-replicative chromatin maturation and TSK, which relies on histone monomethyltransferases and reading of the H3.1 variant.           ,              A histone variant protects the genome                            Histone H3.1 and H3.3 variants are present in proliferative cells of multicellular eukaryotes. Although these two variants are nearly identical, histone H3.1 expression and deposition in chromatin occurs only during DNA replication, which suggests a specific function for this variant during this process. Davarinejad               et al               . discovered that the DNA repair protein TSK/TONSL maintains genome stability during replication by interacting with the H3.1 variant (see the Perspective by Berger). Recognition of H3.1 by the TPR domain of TSK/TONSL regulates the activity of the DNA repair protein, and this role for the H3.1 variant is likely conserved from flowering plants to mammals. —DJ                        ,              The tetratricopeptide repeat domain of TSK reads the histone H3.1 variant to maintain genome stability.},

Substance P is synthesized by small-diameter sensory 'pain' fibres, and release of the peptide into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following intense peripheral stimulation promotes central hyperexcitability and increased sensitivity to pain. However, despite the availability of specific NK-1 antagonists, the function of substance P in the perception of pain remains unclear. Here we investigate the effect of disrupting the gene encoding the NK-1 receptor in mice. We found that the mutant mice were healthy and fertile, but the characteristic amplification ('wind up') and intensity coding of nociceptive reflexes was absent. Although substance P did not mediate the signalling of acute pain or hyperalgesia, it was essential for the full development of stress-induced analgesia and for an aggressive response to territorial challenge, demonstrating that the peptide plays an unexpected role in the adaptive response to stress.},

  abstract = {TSPY, a candidate gene for a factor that promotes gonadoblastoma formation (GBY), is a testis-specific multicopy gene family in the male-specific region of the human Y (MSY) chromosome. Although it was originally proposed that male-specific genes on the Y originated from a transposed copy of an autosomal gene (Lahn \& Page 1999b), at least two male-specific genes (RBMY and SRY) descended from a formerly recombining X-Y identical gene pair. Here we show that a TSPY homologue with similar gene structure lies in conserved positions, close to SMCX, on the X chromosome in human (TSPX ) and mouse (Tspx). TSPX is widely expressed and subject to X inactivation. TSPX and TSPY therefore evolved from an identical gene pair on the original mammalian sex chromosomes. This supports the hypothesis that even male-specific genes on the Y chromosome may have their origin in ubiquitously expressed genes on the X. It also strengthens the case for TSPY as a candidate for GBY, since independent functional studies link TSPX to cell cycle regulation.},

Delgado               et al.               found this positional identity to be sustained by an epigenetic memory system. A morphogen sets the stem cell's identity early in development, but the identity is sustained by epigenetics.

Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a               mixed-lineage leukemia 1               (               Mll1               )–dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.},

  abstract = {Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a tripeptide that is widely distributed in the brain including the hippocampus where TRH receptors are also expressed. TRH has anti-epileptic effects and regulates arousal, sleep, cognition, locomotion and mood. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying such effects remain to be determined. We examined the effects of TRH on GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus and found that TRH increased the frequency of GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous IPSCs in each region of the hippocampus but had no effects on miniature IPSCs or evoked IPSCs. TRH increased the action potential firing frequency recorded from GABAergic interneurons in CA1 stratum radiatum and induced membrane depolarization suggesting that TRH increases the excitability of interneurons to facilitate GABA release. TRH-induced inward current had a reversal potential close to the K+ reversal potential suggesting that TRH inhibits resting K+ channels. The involved K+ channels were sensitive to Ba2+ but resistant to other classical K+ channel blockers, suggesting that TRH inhibits the two-pore domain K+ channels. Because the effects of TRH were mediated via Galphaq/11, but were independent of its known downstream effectors, a direct coupling may exist between Galphaq/11 and K+ channels. Inhibition of the function of dynamin slowed the desensitization of TRH responses. TRH inhibited seizure activity induced by Mg2+ deprivation, but not that generated by picrotoxin, suggesting that TRH-mediated increase in GABA release contributes to its anti-epileptic effects. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism to explain some of the hippocampal actions of TRH.},

Alteration of miRNA levels is common in tumors and contributes to the pathogenesis of human malignancies. In the present study we examined the role played by miR-137 in breast tumorigenesis. We found miR-137 levels to be lower in breast cancer cells than in their non-tumorigenic counterparts and observed reduced proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells overexpressing miR-137. We further identified KDM5B, a histone demethylase known to be involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis, as a target of miR-137. As the involvement of histone demethylases in cancer is still poorly understood and as the role of miRNAs in controlling epigenetic mechanisms in cancer is emerging, we broadened our study to the whole KDM5 histone demethylase family to see if the genes coding for these epigenetic enzymes might be regulated by miRNAs in cancer cells. We discovered that KDM5C is overexpressed in breast cancer cells, providing evidence that miR-138 regulates its expression. We found miR-138 overexpression to affect breast cancer cell proliferation. Altogether, our findings suggest that miRNAs may regulate KDM5 histone demethylase levels in breast cancer and thereby control breast cancer cell proliferation and migration.},

AII thus appears to act via AII receptors and does not cause non-specific inhibition. The injection of saralasin alone yielded LTP comparable to that obtained when vehicle was injected. Angiotensin III was found to be 40-50 fold less potent than AII in blocking LTP. Both AII and AII receptors of unknown function occur in the hippocampal formation.

One class of extragenic transcription products is represented by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which result from Pol\_II transcription of bona-fide RNA genes. Whether all lncRNAs described insofar are products of RNA genes, however, is still unclear. Here we have characterized transcription sites located outside protein-coding genes in a highly regulated response, macrophage activation by endotoxin. Using chromatin signatures, we could unambiguously classify extragenic Pol\_II binding sites as belonging to either canonical RNA genes or transcribed enhancers. Unexpectedly, 70\% of extragenic Pol\_II peaks were associated with genomic regions with a canonical chromatin signature of enhancers. Enhancer-associated extragenic transcription was frequently adjacent to inducible inflammatory genes, was regulated in response to endotoxin stimulation, and generated very low abundance transcripts. Moreover, transcribed enhancers were under purifying selection and contained binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, thus suggesting their functionality. These data demonstrate that a large fraction of extragenic Pol\_II transcription sites can be ascribed to cis-regulatory genomic regions. Discrimination between lncRNAs generated by canonical RNA genes and products of transcribed enhancers will provide a framework for experimental approaches to lncRNAs and help complete the annotation of mammalian genomes.},

The advent of next-generation sequencing and single-cell sequencing technologies has shown that somatic mutations contribute to normal and abnormal human brain development. Somatic mutations are one important cause of neuronal migration and brain overgrowth disorders, as suggested by visible focal lesions. In addition, somatic mutations contribute to neurodevelopmental diseases without visible lesions, including epileptic encephalopathies, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, and may contribute to a broad range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Studying somatic mutations provides insight into the mechanisms underlying human brain development and neurodevelopmental diseases and has important implications for diagnosis and treatment.},

Since a complete description of the underlying pathological processes is not possible for most mental disorders, it is important to emphasize that the current diagnostic criteria are the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians. The classification of disorders is harmonized with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the official coding system used in the United States.

To resolve structure-function relationships, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled single GCs in freely moving rats. We found that the vast majority of neurons were silent during exploration. Most active GCs displayed a characteristic spike waveform, fired at low rates and showed spatial activity. Primary dendritic parameters were sufficient for classifying neurons as active or silent with high accuracy. Our data thus support a sparse coding scheme in the dentate gyrus and provide a possible link between structural and functional heterogeneity among the GC population.},

  abstract = {The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and insulin are localized within distinct brain regions and their respective functions are mediated by specific membrane receptors. High densities of binding sites for these growth factors are discretely and differentially distributed throughout the brain, with prominent levels localized to the hippocampal formation. IGFs and insulin, in addition to their growth promoting actions, are considered to play important roles in the development and maintenance of normal cell functions throughout life. We compared the anatomical distribution and levels of IGF and insulin receptors in young (five month) and aged (25 month) memory-impaired and memory-unimpaired male Long Evans rats as determined in the Morris water maze task in order to determine if alterations in IGF and insulin activity may be related to the emergence of cognitive deficits in the aged memory-impaired rat. In the hippocampus, [125I]IGF-I receptors are concentrated primarily in the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3 sub-field while high amounts of [125I]IGF-II binding sites are localized to the pyramidal cell layer, and the granular cell layer of the DG. [125I]insulin binding sites are mostly found in the molecular layer of the DG and the CA1 sub-field. No significant differences were found in [125I]IGF-I. [125I]IGF-II or [125I]insulin binding levels in any regions or laminae of the hippocampus of young vs aged rats. and deficits in cognitive performance did not relate to altered levels of these receptors in aged memory-impaired vs aged memory-unimpaired rats. Other regions. including various cortical areas, were also examined and failed to reveal any significant differences between the three groups studied. It thus appears that IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin receptor sites are not markedly altered during the normal ageing process in the Long Evans rat, in spite of significant learning deficits in a sub-group (memory-impaired) of aged animals. Hence. recently reported changes in IGF-I receptor messenger RNA levels in aged memory-impaired rats are apparently not reflected at the level of the translated protein.},

In this work, we analyzed how gene expression changes in human tissues are associated with tissue specificity during cancer and ageing using transcriptome data from TCGA and GTEx.                                         Results               We found significant downregulation of tissue-specific genes during ageing in 40\% of the tissues analyzed, which suggests loss of tissue identity with age. For most cancer types, we have noted a consistent pattern of downregulation in genes that are specific to the tissue from which the tumor originated. Moreover, we observed in cancer an activation of genes not usually expressed in the tissue of origin as well as an upregulation of genes specific to other tissues. These patterns in cancer were associated with patient survival. The age of the patient, however, did not influence these patterns.                                         Conclusion               We identified loss of cellular identity in 40\% of the tissues analysed during human ageing, and a clear pattern in cancer, where during tumorigenesis cells express genes specific to other organs while suppressing the expression of genes from their original tissue. The loss of cellular identity observed in cancer is associated with prognosis and is not influenced by age, suggesting that it is a crucial stage in carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Women live longer than men worldwide – and also show cognitive resilience in many aging populations. One major source of biologic difference between the sexes is that females have two X chromosomes and males have one. This difference in sex chromosome complement causes unique X-derived mechanisms that are sex-specific. In mammalian development, one X randomly inactivates in XX cells. One X-derived sex difference is that females are mosaics with the active X chromosome in each cell being either maternally-derived (Xm) or paternally-derived (Xp), whereas males harbor only a maternally-derived X (Xm) in all cells. Interestingly, some females show considerable or complete skew toward Xm or Xp. We utilized several genetic models of sex biology to understand mechanisms of sex difference in aging. We found that the X chromosome contributes to longevity and better cognition in male and female mice. In aging, a genetic manipulation in females to express only the maternally-derived X (Xm), like males, accelerated cognitive decline and epigenetic brain aging. This suggests that Xm is harmful and that female mosaicism (Xm+Xp) provides a buffer to deleterious processes in aging. To assess if Xm alters transcription, we used mice with nuclear localized genetic reporters and sorted Xm from Xp neurons from young and aging XX hippocampi. We found that Xm imprinted several genes within aging hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. Our data suggests that Xm – the maternal X – accelerates brain aging and causes cognitive deficits. Understanding how Xm impairs brain function could increase understanding of female heterogeneity and of sex differences in cognitive heath – and unlock new X-derived pathways against cognitive deficits and brain aging of males, females, or both.},

  abstract = {Significance                            As male sex cells mature into sperm, two pivotal transitions are spermatogonial differentiation (exit from the stem cell pool) and meiotic initiation. These transitions occur in physical proximity, with 8.6-d periodicity. We report that the gene               Stra8               , essential for meiotic initiation, also promotes (but is not required for) spermatogonial differentiation. Moreover, injected RA induces both transitions to occur precociously. We conclude that a periodic RA signal, acting instructively through the common target               Stra8               , coordinates these transitions. This RA signal intersects with two distinct windows of sex-cell competency, which both begin while RA levels are low; sex cells respond quickly to rising RA. These mechanisms help account for the elaborate organization of sperm production, and its prodigious output.                        ,                             Mammalian spermatogenesis—the transformation of stem cells into millions of haploid spermatozoa—is elaborately organized in time and space. We explored the underlying regulatory mechanisms by genetically and chemically perturbing spermatogenesis in vivo, focusing on spermatogonial differentiation, which begins a series of amplifying divisions, and meiotic initiation, which ends these divisions. We first found that, in mice lacking the retinoic acid (RA) target gene               Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8               (               Stra8               ), undifferentiated spermatogonia accumulated in unusually high numbers as early as 10 d after birth, whereas differentiating spermatogonia were depleted. We thus conclude that               Stra8               , previously shown to be required for meiotic initiation, also promotes (but is not strictly required for) spermatogonial differentiation. Second, we found that injection of RA into wild-type adult males induced, independently, precocious spermatogonial differentiation and precocious meiotic initiation; thus, RA acts instructively on germ cells at both transitions. Third, the competencies of germ cells to undergo spermatogonial differentiation or meiotic initiation in response to RA were found to be distinct, periodic, and limited to particular seminiferous stages. Competencies for both transitions begin while RA levels are low, so that the germ cells respond as soon as RA levels rise. Together with other findings, our results demonstrate that periodic RA–STRA8 signaling intersects with periodic germ-cell competencies to regulate two distinct, cell-type-specific responses: spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation. This simple mechanism, with one signal both starting and ending the amplifying divisions, contributes to the prodigious output of spermatozoa and to the elaborate organization of spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, is critical for the production of oocytes and sperm in mammals. These gametes derive from primordial germ cells, which colonize the nascent gonad, and later undertake sexual differentiation to produce oocytes or sperm. During fetal development, germ cells in the ovary initiate meiosis in response to RA, whereas those in the testis do not yet initiate meiosis, as they are insulated from RA, and undergo cell cycle arrest. After birth, male germ cells resume proliferation and undergo a transition to spermatogonia, which are destined to develop into haploid spermatozoa via spermatogenesis. Recent findings indicate that RA levels change periodically in adult testes to direct not only meiotic initiation, but also other key developmental transitions to ensure that spermatogenesis is precisely organized for the prodigious output of sperm. This review focuses on how female and male germ cells develop in the ovary and testis, respectively, and the role of RA in this process.},

A most likely mechanism for the production of uniparental disomy is the chance reunion, and complementation, of 2 gametes aneuploid for the same chromosome member; uniparental disomy could also occur through other mechanisms including postzygotic non-segregation in a trisomic conceptus. Uniparental disomy may result in isodisomy, i.e., homozygosity of a series of contiguous alleles in a pair of homologues. The presence and degree of isodisomy in an offspring depend in turn on the occurrence, timing, and extent of the meiotic recombination that had occurred in the chromosome pair of the disomic gamete involved. Uniparental disomy with or without isodisomy can explain a number of unusual observations, such as the unexpected pattern of transmission of a genetic disorder. The two may be associated with an imprinting effect to produce pathological phenotypes, as has been observed in the mouse, and may be the basis for a number of syndromes of as yet unclear cause. The evidence for uniparental disomy, isodisomy, and imprinting in man is reviewed, and strategies for their detection presented.},

  abstract = {The sensorimotor cortex (SMCx) sends numerous projections to the striatum. These projections are excitatory and glutamate mediated. Glutamatergic receptors, specifically those of NMDA type-receptors, are closely related to excitotoxicity. Thus, in some circumstances, an excess of Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels alters neuronal metabolism and may become lethal for the cell. Two other divalent cations, Mg2+ and Zn2+, have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors. Magnesium ions exert a voltage-dependent block of the NMDA calcium channel, whereas zinc ions exert a voltage-independent NMDA block. In the present work, the effects of iontophoresis of Mg2+ and Zn2+ on the striatal response to SMCx stimulation were studied. Moreover melatonin, an indoleamine with anticonvulsant properties and inhibitory effects on the NMDA receptor, was also iontophorized alone or in combination with Mg2+ and Zn2+. Single pulse electrical stimulation of SMCx produced an excitatory response in the striatum. Iontophoresis of melatonin, Mg2+ and Zn2+ produced a potent attenuation of the excitatory response of the striatum to SMCx stimulation, although the latency of the effect of melatonin was longer than those of Mg2+ and Zn2+. When these cations were simultaneously ejected with melatonin, additive inhibitory effects were recorded. These observations suggest that the inhibitory effects produced by Mg2+ and Zn2+ and melatonin are produced via different processes, and thus the inhibitory role of melatonin on the NMDA receptor activity is exclusive of a direct action on the NMDA calcium channel.},

  abstract = {The insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are key proteins in signal transduction from the insulin receptor. Recently, we discovered a fourth member of this family, designated IRS-4, cloned its complementary DNA from the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, and characterized its signaling properties in this cell line. As part of an investigation of the physiological role of this IRS, we have now cloned the mouse IRS-4 gene and determined its tissue expression and chromosomal location. The coding region of the mouse IRS-4 gene contains no introns, and in this regard is the same as that of the genes for IRS-1 and -2. The predicted amino acid sequence of mouse IRS-4 is highly homologous with that of human IRS-4; the pleckstrin homology domain, the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs are especially well conserved. The tissue distribution of IRS-4 in the mouse was determined by analysis for the expression of its messenger RNA by RT-PCR and for the protein itself by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The messenger RNA was detected in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, kidney, and liver, but the protein itself was not detected in any tissue. These results indicate that IRS-4 is a very rare protein. The chromosomal locations of the mouse IRS-4 and IRS-3 genes were determined by interspecific back-cross analysis and were found to be on chromosomes X and 5, respectively. As the mouse genes for IRS-1 and -2 are on chromosomes 1 and 8, respectively, each IRS gene resides on a different chromosome.},

  abstract = {This review presents data from laboratory studies and clinical trials indicating the efficacy of the "Noradrenergic Strategy" for enhancing recovery after cortical injury. Short-term acute treatment combining Physical Therapy (PT) with drugs increasing noradrenaline (NA) levels enhances recovery of hemiplegia in both laboratory studies and clinical trials which also report improved aphasia recovery. Importantly these effects endure even when treatment is initiated months after stroke onset. The hypothesized mechanisms included modulation of neuronal processes underlying "spontaneous" recovery since drugs reducing NA levels slow spontaneous recovery. The effect of some drugs change with time after sensorimotor cortex (SMCx) injury. Drugs reducing NA levels, including clonidine and prazosin, and GABA receptor agonists at doses having little effect early after injury, when administered to animals or stroke patients after "complete recovery" transiently reinstate the original symptoms. Reinstatement by prazosin remains unchanged after repeated testing for over six months in rat, and the deficits can be as severe as the first days after injury. This suggests "completed" recovery is an inaccurate label for an enduring "fragile" state. This transient reinstatement of symptoms may be useful for distinguishing causal from corollary relationships between symptoms and physiological processes proposed as mechanisms for recovery of function.},

  abstract = {The goal of these experiments was to evaluate the effects of some drugs affecting noradrenergic (NE) synaptic transmission, commonly prescribed following stroke or traumatic brain injury, on functional recovery. Measurement of recovery from a transient hemiplegia produced by a traumatic unilateral focal contusion in sensorimotor cortex (SMCX) of rats was used to assess the effects of chronic haloperidol (HAL) treatment begun early (1 day) or late (18 days to recovered animals) after injury. Additionally, using the same model, the effects of a single administration of drugs with selective action at NE receptors were also evaluated early or late (30 days) after injury. These drugs were: phenoxybenzamine (PBZ), an alpha 1-NE antagonist; prazosin (PRAZ), an alpha 1-NE antagonist; yohimbine (YOH), an alpha 2-NE antagonist; propranolol (PROP), a beta 1- and 2-NE receptor antagonist; methoxymine (METHOX), an alpha 1-NE agonist; and clonidine (CLON), an alpha 2-NE agonist. The data indicate that drugs with antagonistic effects at alpha 1 NE receptors, including HAL and PRAZ but not PROP, administered early after SMCX contusion retard locomotor recovery. Beneficial effects of enhancing NE transmission by METHOX or YOH were not observed. In animals recovered from beam walk (BW) deficits, a single administration of PBZ or PRAZ (alpha 1 NE antagonists) or CLON (alpha 2 NE agonist) transiently reinstated hemiplegic symptoms. The nonspecific beta NE receptor antagonist PROP had no effect in recovered animals. A single dose of HAL had no effect in recovered animals, but a BW deficit transiently developed in some animals following chronic treatment. The data are discussed with reference to drug contraindications noted in clinical studies of recovery from poststroke aphasia and cognition in demented patients with degenerative brain disease.},

Several studies have employed brain organoid technologies to elucidate human-specific processes of brain development, gene expression, and cellular maturation by comparing human-derived brain organoids to those of non-human primates (NHPs). Brain organoids have been established from a variety of NHP pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines and many protocols are now available for generating brain organoids capable of reproducibly representing specific brain region identities. Innumerous combinations of brain region specific organoids derived from different human and NHP PSCs, with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing techniques and strategies to promote advanced stages of maturation, will successfully establish complex brain model systems for the accurate representation and elucidation of human brain development. Identified human-specific processes of brain development are likely vulnerable to dysregulation and could result in the identification of therapeutic targets or disease prevention strategies. Here, we discuss the potential of brain organoids to successfully model human-specific processes of brain development and explore current strategies for pinpointing these differences.},

Transcriptome-wide analysis following genetic loss of m6A reveals hundreds of transcripts that exhibit altered subcellular localization in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, using a reporter system, we show that mutation of specific m6A sites in select neuronal transcripts diminishes their localization to neurites. Single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments further confirm our findings and identify the m6A reader proteins YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 as mediators of this effect. Our findings reveal a novel function for m6A in controlling mRNA localization in neurons and enable a better understanding of the mechanisms through which m6A influences gene expression in the brain.},

  abstract = {Uniparental disomy (UPD), in which an individual contains a pair of homologous chromosomes originating from only one parent, is a frequent phenomenon that is linked to congenital disorders and various cancers. UPD is thought to result mostly from pre- or post-zygotic chromosome missegregation. However, the factors that drive UPD remain unknown. Here we use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to investigate UPD, and show that defects in the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery or in the YTH domain-containing RNA elimination factor Mmi1 cause high levels of UPD in vegetative diploid cells. This phenomenon is not due to defects in heterochromatin assembly at centromeres. Notably, in cells lacking RNAi components or Mmi1, UPD is associated with the untimely expression of gametogenic genes. Deletion of the upregulated gene encoding the meiotic cohesin Rec8 or the cyclin Crs1 suppresses UPD in both RNAi and mmi1 mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Rec8 is sufficient to trigger UPD in wild-type cells. Rec8 expressed in vegetative cells localizes to chromosomal arms and to the centromere core, where it is required for localization of the cohesin subunit Psc3. The centromeric localization of Rec8 and Psc3 promotes UPD by uniquely affecting chromosome segregation, causing a reductional segregation of one homologue. Together, these findings establish the untimely vegetative expression of gametogenic genes as a causative factor of UPD, and provide a solid foundation for understanding this phenomenon, which is linked to diverse human diseases.},

  abstract = {Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is a major HDAC protein in the adult brain and has been shown to regulate many neuronal genes. The aberrant expression of HDAC2 and subsequent dysregulation of neuronal gene expression is implicated in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (hiPSC-Ns) are widely used models for studying neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, but the role of HDAC2 in hiPSC-N differentiation and maturation has not been explored. In this study, we show that levels of HDAC2 progressively decrease as hiPSCs are differentiated towards neurons. This suppression of HDAC2 inversely corresponds to an increase in neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1, a multifunctional protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. Expression of neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 is accompanied by concomitant expression of a neuron-specific alternative splicing factor, SRRM4. Manipulation of HDAC2 and Endophilin-B1 using lentiviral approaches shows that the knock-down of HDAC2 or the overexpression of a neuron-specific Endophilin-B1 isoform promotes mitochondrial elongation and protects against cytotoxic stress in hiPSC-Ns, while HDAC2 knock-down specifically influences genes regulating mitochondrial dynamics and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, HDAC2 knock-down promotes enhanced mitochondrial respiration and reduces levels of neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides. Collectively, our study demonstrates a role for HDAC2 in hiPSC-neuronal differentiation, highlights neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 as a marker of differentiating hiPSC-Ns and demonstrates that HDAC2 regulates key neuronal and mitochondrial pathways in hiPSC-Ns.},

This phenomenon is accompanied by attenuated receptor expression of insulin and insulin-like growth factor, enhanced serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and impaired transport of insulin across the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal insulin improves both memory performance and metabolic integrity of the brain in patients suffering from AD or its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment. These results, in conjunction with the finding that insulin mitigates hippocampal synapse vulnerability to beta amyloid, a peptide thought to be causative in the development of AD, provide a strong rationale for hypothesizing that pharmacological strategies bolstering brain insulin signaling, such as intranasal administration of insulin, could have significant potential in the treatment and prevention of AD. With this view in mind, the review at hand will present molecular mechanisms potentially underlying the memory-enhancing and neuroprotective effects of intranasal insulin. Then, we will discuss the results of intranasal insulin studies that have demonstrated that enhancing brain insulin signaling improves memory and learning processes in both cognitively healthy and impaired humans. Finally, we will provide an overview of neuroimaging studies indicating that disturbances in insulin metabolism–such as insulin resistance in obesity, type 2 diabetes and AD–and altered brain responses to insulin are linked to decreased cerebral volume and especially to hippocampal atrophy.},

Boule and Dazl are situated on autosomes while DAZ, exclusive of higher primates, is located on the Y chromosome. Deletion of DAZ gene is the most common causes of infertility in humans. These genes, encoding for RNA binding proteins, contain a highly conserved RNA recognition motif and at least one DAZ repeat encoding for a 24 amino acids sequence able to bind other mRNA binding proteins. Basically, Daz family proteins function as adaptors for target mRNA transport and activators of their translation. In some invertebrate species, BOULE protein play a pivotal role in germline specification and a conserved regulatory role in meiosis. Depending on the species, DAZL is expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and/or pre-meiotic and meiotic germ cells of both sexes. Daz is found in fetal gonocytes, spermatogonia and spermatocytes of adult testes. Here we discuss DAZ family genes in a phylogenic perspective, focusing on the common and distinct features of these genes, and their pivotal roles during gametogenesis evolved during evolution.},

In adult tissues, Mvh transcripts were exclusively detected in testicular germ cells, in which Mvh protein was found to be localized in cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids including a perinuclear granule. The protein was also expressed in germ cells colonized in embryonic gonads but was not detected in pluripotential embryonic cells such as stem cells and germ cells.

MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that has been proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but despite numerous mouse studies examining neuronal gene expression in Mecp2 mutants, no clear model has emerged for how MeCP2 protein regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in gene expression in MeCP2 mutant mouse models and human RTT brains. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses gene expression by binding to methylated CA sites within long genes, and that in neurons lacking MeCP2, decreasing the expression of long genes attenuates RTT-associated cellular deficits. In addition, we find that long genes as a population are enriched for neuronal functions and selectively expressed in the brain. These findings suggest that mutations in MeCP2 may cause neurological dysfunction by specifically disrupting long gene expression in the brain.},

Vis à vis other species, the human brain displays unique functional and morphological features that result from this extensive developmental process that is, unsurprisingly, highly vulnerable to both genetically and environmentally induced alterations. One of the most striking outcomes of the recent surge of sequencing-based studies on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is the emergence of chromatin regulation as one of the two domains most affected by causative mutations or Copy Number Variations besides synaptic function, whose involvement had been largely predicted for obvious reasons. These observations place chromatin dysfunction at the top of the molecular pathways hierarchy that ushers in a sizeable proportion of NDDs and that manifest themselves through synaptic dysfunction and recurrent systemic clinical manifestation. Here we undertake a conceptual investigation of chromatin dysfunction in NDDs with the aim of systematizing the available evidence in a new framework: first, we tease out the developmental vulnerabilities in human corticogenesis as a structuring entry point into the causation of NDDs; second, we provide a much needed clarification of the multiple meanings and explanatory frameworks revolving around "epigenetics", highlighting those that are most relevant for the analysis of these disorders; finally we go in-depth into paradigmatic examples of NDD-causing chromatin dysregulation, with a special focus on human experimental models and datasets.},

  abstract = {Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as synaptic scaling are critically dependent on transcription. Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ∼45\% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {In fluctuating environments, switching between different growth strategies, such as those affecting cell size and proliferation, can be advantageous to an organism. Trade-offs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation—such as mutations or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways—can also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. We find that a highly conserved RNA-modifying enzyme, the pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB, can act as a prion, endowing yeast with greater proliferation rates at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Cells harboring the prion grow larger and exhibit altered protein synthesis. This epigenetic state, [               BIG               +               ] (               b               etter               i               n                                g                              rowth), allows cells to heritably yet reversibly alter their translational program, leading to the differential synthesis of dozens of proteins, including many that regulate proliferation and aging. Our data reveal a new role for prion-based control of an RNA-modifying enzyme in driving heritable epigenetic states that transform cell growth and survival.                        ,              Cells make different proteins to perform different tasks. Each protein is a long chain of building blocks called amino acids that must fold into a particular shape before it can be useful. Some proteins can fold in more than one way, a normal form and a ‘prion’ form. Prions are unusual in that they can force normally folded proteins with the same amino acid sequence as them to refold into new prions. This means that a single prion can make many more that are inherited when cells divide. Some prions can cause disease, but others may be beneficial.                            Pus4 is a yeast protein that is typically involved in modifying ribonucleic acids, molecules that help translate genetic information into new proteins. Sometimes Pus4 can adopt a beneficial prion conformation called [               BIG               +               ]. When yeast cells have access to plenty of nutrients, [               BIG               +               ] helps them grow faster and larger, but this comes at the cost of a shorter lifespan.                                         Garcia, Campbell et al. combined computational modeling and experiments in baker’s yeast (               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               ) to investigate the role of [               BIG               +               ]. They found that the prion accelerated protein production, leading to both faster growth and a shorter lifespan in these cells, even without any changes in gene sequence.                          Garcia, Campbell et al.’s findings explain the beneficial activity of prion proteins in baker’s yeast cells. The results also describe how cells balance a tradeoff between growth and lifespan without any changes in the genome. This helps to highlight that genetics do not always explain the behaviors of cells, and further methods are needed to better understand cell biology.},

Tsix RNA is believed to orchestrate the initiation of X-inactivation, influencing the choice of which X remains active by preventing expression of the antisense Xist RNA, which is required to silence the inactive-X. Here we profile X-chromosome activity in Tsix-mutant (X(ΔTsix)) mouse embryonic epiblasts, epiblast stem cells, and embryonic stem cells. Unexpectedly, we find that Xist is stably repressed on the X(ΔTsix) in both sexes in undifferentiated epiblast cells in vivo and in vitro, resulting in stochastic X-inactivation in females despite Tsix-heterozygosity. Tsix is instead required to silence Xist on the active-X as epiblast cells differentiate in both males and females. Thus, Tsix is not required at the onset of random X-inactivation; instead, it protects the active-X from ectopic silencing once X-inactivation has commenced.},

However, aging alters neuron morphology and function resulting in age-related cognitive decline. It is well established that epigenetic alterations are essential for learning and memory, yet few neuron-specific genome-wide epigenetic maps exist into old age. Comprehensive mapping of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in mouse neurons across lifespan revealed plastic H3K4me3 marking that differentiates neuronal age linked to known characteristics of cellular and neuronal aging. We determined that neurons in old age recapitulate the H3K27ac enrichment at promoters, enhancers and super enhancers from young adult neurons, likely representing a re-activation of pathways to maintain neuronal output. Finally, this study identified new characteristics of neuronal aging, including altered rDNA regulation and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Collectively, these findings indicate a key role for epigenetic regulation in neurons, that is inextricably linked with aging.},

This study examined whether exposure to maternal depression during childhood might predict increased aggression and/or depression in early adulthood, and whether offspring amygdala:hippocampal volume ratio might mediate this relationship.|Participants were 258 mothers and sons at socioeconomic risk for behavior problems. Sons' trajectories of exposure to maternal depression were generated from eight reports collected prospectively from offspring ages 18 months to 10 years.

In contrast, stable and very elevated trajectories of maternal depression during childhood predicted depression in adult offspring. Increased amygdala: hippocampal volume ratios at age 20 were significantly associated with concurrently increased aggression, but not depression, in adult offspring. Offspring amygdala: hippocampal volume ratio mediated the relationship found between trajectories of moderately elevated maternal depression during childhood and aggression in adult offspring.|Alterations in the relative size of brain structures implicated in emotion regulation may be one mechanism by which offspring of depressed mothers incur increased risk for the development of aggression.},

  abstract = {Mammalian oocytes and spermatozoa derive from fetal cells shared by the sexes. These primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate to the developing somatic gonad, giving rise to oocytes or spermatozoa. These opposing sexual fates are determined not by the PGCs' own sex chromosome constitution (XX or XY), but by the sexual identity of the fetal gonad that they enter. We asked whether PGCs undergo a developmental transition that enables them to respond to feminizing or masculinizing cues from fetal ovary or testis. We conducted in vivo genetic studies of DAZL, an RNA-binding protein expressed in both ovarian and testicular germ cells. We found that germ cells in C57BL/6 Dazl–deficient fetuses-whether XX or XY–migrate to the gonad but do not develop either male or female features. Instead, they remain in a sexually undifferentiated state similar to that of migrating PGCs. Thus, germ cells in C57BL/6 Dazl-deficient fetuses do not respond to sexual cues from ovary or testis, whereas the earlier processes of germ cell specification and migration are unaffected. We propose that PGCs of both XX and XY fetuses undergo licensing, an active developmental transition that enables the resultant gametogenesis-competent cells to respond to feminizing or masculinizing cues produced by the fetal ovary or testis and hence to embark on oogenesis or spermatogenesis. In C57BL/6 mice, Dazl is required for licensing. Licensing serves as a gateway from the embryonic processes shared between the sexes–germ cell specification and migration–to the sex-specific pathways of oogenesis and spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type. Here, we show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies. To determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq. We found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, we found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5′ UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. To extend these findings, we compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. We found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.           ,              The information required to build a specific protein is encoded into molecules of RNA which are often trafficked to precise locations in a cell. These journeys require a complex molecular machinery to be assembled and set in motion so that the RNA can be transported along dynamic ‘roads’ called microtubules. The details of this mechanism are known only for a handful of RNAs in a few cell types; for example, scientists have uncovered the signals presiding over the shuttling of certain RNAs to the axon, the long and thin projection that a neuron uses to communicate. Yet these RNAs are also present in cells that lack axons. Whether the molecular processes which preside over RNA movement apply across cell types has so far remained unclear.             To investigate this question, Goering et al. tracked the location of RNA molecules in two types of polarized mouse cells: neurons which feature an axon, and ‘epithelial’ cells which line the intestine. The experiments revealed that the signals sending RNAs to the axons also directed the molecules towards the bottom pole of epithelial cells. In both cases, the RNAs travelled towards the extremity of the growing, “plus” end of the microtubules.             Overall, this work suggests that RNA transport mechanisms should not be thought of as leading to a particular location in the cell; instead, they may be following more generalisable instructions. This knowledge could allow scientists to predict where a particular RNA will be sent across cell types based on data from one cell population. It could also aid the development of synthetic RNAs that target specific parts of the cell, offering greater control over their actions.},

Molecular characterization of Zmym2−/− embryos revealed two distinct defects. First, they fail to undergo DNA methylation and silencing of germline gene promoters, resulting in widespread upregulation of germline genes. Second, they fail to methylate and silence the evolutionarily youngest and most active LINE element subclasses in mice. Zmym2−/− embryos show ubiquitous overexpression of LINE-1 protein as well as aberrant expression of transposon-gene fusion transcripts. ZMYM2 homes to sites of PRC1.6 and TRIM28 complex binding, mediating repression of germline genes and transposons respectively. In the absence of ZMYM2, hypermethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 occurs at target sites, creating a chromatin landscape unfavourable for establishment of DNA methylation. ZMYM2−/− human embryonic stem cells also show aberrant upregulation and demethylation of young LINE elements, indicating a conserved role in repression of active transposons. ZMYM2 is thus an important new factor in DNA methylation patterning in early embryonic development.},

Our analysis revealed a continuous developmental trajectory of germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids and identified candidate transcriptional regulators at several transition points during differentiation. Focused analyses delineated four subtypes of spermatogonia and nine subtypes of Sertoli cells; the latter linked to histologically defined developmental stages over the seminiferous epithelial cycle.

  abstract = {We recently have identified a ubiquitously transcribed mouse Y chromosome gene, Uty , which encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein. A peptide derived from the UTY protein confers H-Y antigenicity on male cells. Here we report the characterization of a widely transcribed X-linked homologue of Uty , called Utx , which maps to the proximal region of the mouse X chromosome and which detects a human X-linked homologue at Xp11.2. Given that Uty is ubiquitously transcribed, we assayed for Utx expression from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in mice and found that Utx escapes X chromosome inactivation. Only Smcx and the pseudoautosomal Sts gene on the mouse X chromosome have been reported previously to escape inactivation. The human UTX gene was also found to be expressed from Xi. We discuss the significance of these data for our understanding of dosage compensation of X-Y homologous genes in humans and mice.},

  abstract = {Insulin receptors (IRs) are expressed in discrete neuronal populations in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. To elucidate the functional role of hippocampal IRs independent of metabolic function, we generated a model of hippocampal-specific insulin resistance using a lentiviral vector expressing an IR antisense sequence (LV-IRAS). LV-IRAS effectively downregulates IR expression in the rat hippocampus without affecting body weight, adiposity, or peripheral glucose homeostasis. Nevertheless, hippocampal neuroplasticity was impaired in LV-IRAS-treated rats. High-frequency stimulation, which evoked robust long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices from LV control rats, failed to evoke LTP in LV-IRAS-treated rats. GluN2B subunit levels, as well as the basal level of phosphorylation of GluA1, were reduced in the hippocampus of LV-IRAS rats. Moreover, these deficits in synaptic transmission were associated with impairments in spatial learning. We suggest that alterations in the expression and phosphorylation of glutamate receptor subunits underlie the alterations in LTP and that these changes are responsible for the impairment in hippocampal-dependent learning. Importantly, these learning deficits are strikingly similar to the impairments in complex task performance observed in patients with diabetes, which strengthens the hypothesis that hippocampal insulin resistance is a key mediator of cognitive deficits independent of glycemic control.},

  abstract = {Benefits of increased size and functional specialization of cells have repeatedly promoted the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors. Many requirements for multicellular organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps the most important being development from a unicell, which minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck, defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages. Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular organisms that develop by aggregation generally exhibit less differentiation than organisms that develop clonally.},

The localization and timing of neuronal progenitor proliferation and of neuronal migration define the identity, laminar positioning, and specific connectivity of each single cortical neuron. Alterations at any step of this organized series of events-due to genetic mutations or environmental factors-lead to defined brain pathologies collectively known as malformations of cortical development (MCDs), which are now recognized as a leading cause of drug-resistant epilepsy and intellectual disability. In this heterogeneous group of disorders, macroscopic alterations of brain structure (eg, heterotopic nodules, small or absent gyri, double cortex) can be recognized and probably subtend a general reorganization of neuronal circuits. In this review, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms that are implicated in the generation of genetic MCDs associated with aberrations at various steps of neurogenesis and cortical development.},

While the majority of epiblast cells undergo differentiation towards somatic cell lineages, PGCs initiate a unique cellular programme driven by the cooperation of the transcription factors BLIMP1, PRDM14 and AP2γ. These factors synergistically suppress the ongoing somatic differentiation and drive the re-expression of pluripotency and germ cell-specific genes accompanied by global epigenetic changes. However, an unresolved question is how postimplantation epiblast cells acquire the developmental competence for the PGC fate downstream of BMP/WNT signalling. One emerging concept is that transcriptional enhancers might play a central role in the establishment of developmental competence and the execution of cell fate determination. Here, we discuss recent advances on the specification and reprogramming of PGCs thereby highlighting the concept of enhancer function.},

In this study, L3MBTL2, a human homolog of Drosophila Sfmbt critical for Hox gene silencing, is demonstrated to preferentially recognize lower methylation states of several histone-derived peptides through its fourth MBT repeat. High-resolution crystallographic analysis of the four MBT repeats of this protein reveals its unique asymmetric rhomboid architecture, as well as binding mechanism, which preclude the interaction of the first three MBT repeats with methylated peptides. Structural elucidation of an L3MBTL2-H4K20me1 complex and comparison with other MBT-histone peptide complexes also suggests that an absence of distinct surface contours surrounding the methyl-lysine-binding pocket may underlie the lack of sequence specificity observed for members of this protein family.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Studies of the genetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have largely focused on single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions. However, most of the disease heritability has yet to be uncovered, suggesting that there is substantial genetic risk conferred by other forms of genetic variation. There are over one million short tandem repeats (STRs) in the genome, and their link to AD risk has not been assessed. As pathogenic expansions of STR cause over 30 neurologic diseases, it is important to ascertain whether STRs may also be implicated in AD risk. Here, we genotyped 321,742 polymorphic STR tracts genome-wide using PCR-free whole genome sequencing data from 2,981 individuals (1,489 AD case and 1,492 control individuals). We implemented an approach to identify STR expansions as STRs with tract lengths that are outliers from the population. We then tested for differences in aggregate burden of expansions in case versus control individuals. AD patients had a 1.19-fold increase of STR expansions compared to healthy elderly controls (p=8.27×10             −3             , two-sided Mann Whitney test). Individuals carrying {$>$} 30 STR expansions had 3.62-fold higher odds of having AD and had more severe AD neuropathology. AD STR expansions were highly enriched within active promoters in post-mortem hippocampal brain tissues and particularly within SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons. Together, these results demonstrate that expanded STRs within active promoter regions of the genome promote risk of AD.},

We analyze more than 150,000 single cells from both OSK and chemical reprograming and identify additional NR/RP bifurcation points.

In this study, we investigated the contribution of another histone modification, histone methylation, to memory formation in the adult hippocampus. We found that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), an active mark for transcription, is upregulated in hippocampus 1 h following contextual fear conditioning. In addition, we found that dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a molecular mark associated with transcriptional silencing, is increased 1 h after fear conditioning and decreased 24 h after context exposure alone and contextual fear conditioning. Trimethylated H3K4 levels returned to baseline levels at 24 h. We also found that mice deficient in the H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase, Mll, displayed deficits in contextual fear conditioning relative to wild-type animals. This suggests that histone methylation is required for proper long-term consolidation of contextual fear memories. Interestingly, inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with sodium butyrate (NaB) resulted in increased H3K4 trimethylation and decreased H3K9 dimethylation in hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning. Correspondingly, we found that fear learning triggered increases in H3K4 trimethylation at specific gene promoter regions (Zif268 and bdnf) with altered DNA methylation and MeCP2 DNA binding. Zif268 DNA methylation levels returned to baseline at 24 h. Together, these data demonstrate that histone methylation is actively regulated in the hippocampus and facilitates long-term memory formation.},

  abstract = {Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) erase global DNA methylation (5mC) as part of the comprehensive epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during PGC development. 5mC plays an important role in maintaining stable gene silencing and repression of transposable elements (TE) but it is not clear how the extensive loss of DNA methylation impacts on gene expression and TE repression in developing PGCs. Using a novel epigenetic disruption and recovery screen and genetic analyses, we identified a core set of germline-specific genes that are dependent exclusively on promoter DNA methylation for initiation and maintenance of developmental silencing. These gene promoters appear to possess a specialised chromatin environment that does not acquire any of the repressive H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3 or H4K20me3 histone modifications when silenced by DNA methylation. Intriguingly, this methylation-dependent subset is highly enriched in genes with roles in suppressing TE activity in germ cells. We show that the mechanism for developmental regulation of the germline genome-defence genes involves DNMT3B-dependent de novo DNA methylation. These genes are then activated by lineage-specific promoter demethylation during distinct global epigenetic reprogramming events in migratory (∼E8.5) and post-migratory (E10.5-11.5) PGCs. We propose that genes involved in genome defence are developmentally regulated primarily by promoter DNA methylation as a sensory mechanism that is coupled to the potential for TE activation during global 5mC erasure, thereby acting as a failsafe to ensure TE suppression and maintain genomic integrity in the germline.},

However, the molecular biological processes underlying this phenomenon are not understood. In this study, we report the outcome of testicular RNA profiling for genes involved in long-term memory formation. We analyzed the histology and the transcriptome of testicular biopsies from bilateral HIR cryptorchid boys, comparing those who received GnRHa treatment for 6 months after the first surgery with those who did not receive GnRHa before the second surgery. We found that GnRHa treatment alters the testicular mRNA levels of neuronal genes that are involved in long-term memory and testosterone synthesis. These data highlight a possible molecular link between cryptorchidism, impaired mini-puberty, and diminished cognitive functions. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in cryptorchid boys with altered mini-puberty may affect neuronal genes important for memory and learning, which could help explaining the negative correlation between cryptorchidism and intellectual abilities.},

Hypomethylation of DNA of a small fraction of the genome is an unusual feature of ICF patients which is explained by mutations in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3B in some, but not all, ICF patients.|To obtain a comprehensive description of the clinical features of this syndrome as well as genotype-phenotype correlations in ICF patients.|Data on ICF patients were obtained by literature search and additional information by means of questionnaires to corresponding authors.|45 patients all with proven centromeric instability were included in this study. Facial dysmorphism was found to be a common characteristic (n = 41/42), especially epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge and low set ears. Hypo- or agammaglobulinaemia was demonstrated in nearly all patients (n = 39/44). Opportunistic infections were seen in several patients, pointing to a T cell dysfunction. Haematological malignancy was documented in two patients. Life expectancy of ICF patients is poor, especially those with severe infections in infancy or chronic gastrointestinal problems and failure to thrive. Early diagnosis of ICF is important since early introduction of immunoglobulin supplementation can improve the course of the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with severe infections or failure to thrive. Only 19 of 34 patients showed mutations in DNMT3B, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with and without DNMT3B mutations.},

  abstract = {BRAF35, a structural DNA-binding protein, initially was identified as a component of a large BRCA2-containing complex. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of a smaller core-BRAF35 complex devoid of BRCA2. Here we report the isolation of a six-subunit core-BRAF35 complex with the capacity to deacetylate histones, termed the BRAF-histone deacetylase complex (BHC), from human cells. BHC contains polypeptides reminiscent of the chromatin-remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating). Similar to NuRD, BHC contains an Mi2-like subunit, BHC80, and a PHD zinc-finger subunit as well as histone deacetylases 1/2 and an MTA-like subunit, the transcriptional corepressor CoREST. We show that BHC mediates repression of neuron-specific genes through the cis-regulatory element known as the repressor element 1 or neural restrictive silencer (RE1/NRS). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate the recruitment of BHC by the neuronal repressor REST. Expression of BRAF35 containing a single point mutation in the HMG domain of the protein abrogated REST-mediated transcriptional repression. These results demonstrate a role for core-BRAF35-containing complex in the regulation of neuron-specific genes through modulation of the chromatin structure.},

In this review, we examine the variability in the individual peptides produced in different tissues and the impact of the simultaneous presence of their precursors or fragments. We also discuss the problems inherent in accurately measuring which of the precursors and their derived peptides are present in biological samples. We address how not being able to measure all the combinations of precursors and fragments quantitatively has affected our understanding of the pathophysiology associated with POMC processing. To understand how different ratios of peptides arise, we describe the role of the pro-hormone convertases (PCs) and their tissue specificities and consider the cellular processing pathways which enable regulated secretion of different peptides that play crucial roles in integrating a range of vital physiological functions. In the pituitary, correct processing of POMC peptides is essential to maintain the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and this processing can be disrupted in POMC-expressing tumors. In hypothalamic neurons expressing POMC, abnormalities in processing critically impact on the regulation of appetite, energy homeostasis, and body composition. More work is needed to understand whether expression of the POMC gene in a tissue equates to release of bioactive peptides. We suggest that this comprehensive view of POMC processing, with a focus on gaining a better understanding of the combination of peptides produced and their relative bioactivity, is a necessity for all involved in studying this fascinating physiological regulatory phenomenon.},

The gene encoding human p57KIP is located on chromosome 11p15.5 (ref. 2), a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it a tumour suppressor candidate. Several types of childhood tumours including Wilm's tumour, adrenocortical carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma display a specific loss of maternal 11p15 alleles, suggesting that genomic imprinting plays an important part. Genetic analysis of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has indicated maternal carriers as well as suggested a role in genomic imprinting. Here, as a first step towards elucidating the genesis of human cancers in this region, we showed that a mouse homologue of p57KIP2 is genomically imprinted. The paternally inherited allele is transcriptionally repressed and methylated. This murine gene maps to the distal region of chromosome 7, within a cluster of imprinted genes, including insulin-2, insulin-like growth factor-2, H19 and Mash2 (refs 14-18).},

We demonstrate here the generation of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) in mice with robust capacity for spermatogenesis. PGCLCs were generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), a cellular state highly similar to pregastrulating epiblasts but distinct from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). Reflecting epiblast development, EpiLC induction from ESCs/iPSCs is a progressive process, and EpiLCs highly competent for the PGC fate are a transient entity. The global transcription profiles, epigenetic reprogramming, and cellular dynamics during PGCLC induction from EpiLCs meticulously capture those associated with PGC specification from the epiblasts. Furthermore, we identify Integrin-β3 and SSEA1 as markers that allow the isolation of PGCLCs with spermatogenic capacity from tumorigenic undifferentiated cells. Our findings provide a paradigm for the first step of in vitro gametogenesis.},

We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2).

  author = {Henriques, William S},
  abstract = {Selfish genetic elements comprise significant fractions of mammalian genomes. In rare instances, host genomes domesticate segments of these elements for function. Using a complete human genome assembly and 25 add­ itional vertebrate genomes, we re-analyzed the evolutionary trajectories and functional potential of capsid (CA) genes domesticated from Metaviridae, a lineage of retrovirus-like retrotransposons. Our study expands on previous analyses to unearth several new insights about the evolutionary histories of these ancient genes. We find that at least five independent domestication events occurred from diverse Metaviridae, giving rise to three universally retained single-copy genes evolving under purifying selection and two gene families unique to placental mammals, with multiple members showing evidence of rapid evolution. In the SIRH/RTL family, we find diverse amino-terminal domains, widespread loss of protein-coding capacity in RTL10 despite its reten­ tion in several mammalian lineages, and differential utilization of an ancient programmed ribosomal frameshift in RTL3 between the domesticated CA and protease domains. Our analyses also reveal that most members of the PNMA family in mammalian genomes encode a conserved putative amino-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) both adjoining and independent from domesticated CA domains. Our analyses lead to a significant correction of previous annotations of the essential CCDC8 gene. We show that this putative RBD is also present in several extant Metaviridae, revealing a novel protein domain configuration in retrotransposons. Collectively, our study reveals the divergent outcomes of multiple domestication events from diverse Metaviridae in the common ances­ tor of placental mammals.},

Their activity and localization is regulated by the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, and so far no GEFs or GAPs have been identified for them. Similar to Rac and Cdc42, they interact with PAK serine/threonine kinases, and in the case of PAK4, this interaction leads to RhoU protein stabilization. In cells, RhoU and RhoV alter cell shape and cell adhesion, which probably underlies some of the phenotypes reported for these proteins},

However, few studies have examined the rationales of these enrichment analysis strategies. Using both microarray and RNA-seq data, we show that gene pairs with functional links in pathways tended to have positively correlated expression levels, which could result in an imbalance between the up- and downregulated genes in particular pathways. We then show that the imbalance could greatly reduce the statistical power for finding disease-associated pathways through the analysis of all-DE genes. Further, using gene expression profiles from five types of tumours, we illustrate that the separate analysis of up- and downregulated genes could identify more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotypic difference. In conclusion, analysing up- and downregulated genes separately is more powerful than analysing all of the DE genes together.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients display hippocampal atrophy, memory impairment, and cognitive decline. New neurons are generated throughout adulthood in 2 regions of the brain implicated in AD, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the olfactory bulb. Disruption of this process contributes to neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and many of the molecular players in AD are also modulators of adult neurogenesis. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis in AD have been underexplored. To address this gap, we performed a gene-based association analysis in cognitively normal and impaired participants using neurogenesis pathway-related candidate genes curated from existing databases, literature mining, and large-scale genome-wide association study findings. A gene-based association analysis identified adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) as significantly associated with hippocampal volume and the association between rs9608282 within ADORA2A and hippocampal volume was replicated in the meta-analysis after multiple comparison adjustments (p = 7.88 × 10},

  abstract = {Vertebrate eggs can induce the nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells to enable production of cloned animals. Nuclear reprogramming is relatively inefficient, and the development of the resultant embryos is frequently compromised, in part due to the inappropriate expression of genes previously active in the donor nucleus. Here, we identify H3K4 methylation as a major epigenetic roadblock that limits transcriptional reprogramming and efficient nuclear transfer (NT). Widespread expression of donor-cell-specific genes was observed in inappropriate cell types in NT embryos, limiting their developmental capacity. The expression of these genes in reprogrammed embryos arises from epigenetic memories of a previously active transcriptional state in donor cells that is characterized by high H3K4 methylation. Reducing H3K4 methylation had little effect on gene expression in donor cells, but it substantially improved transcriptional reprogramming and development of NT embryos. These results show that H3K4 methylation imposes a barrier to efficient nuclear reprogramming and suggest approaches for improving reprogramming strategies.},

Because of this association, H3K4me3 is often described as an 'activating' histone modification and assumed to have an instructive role in the transcription of genes, but the field is lacking a conserved mechanism to support this view. The overwhelming finding from genome-wide studies is that actually very little transcription changes upon removal of most H3K4me3 under steady-state or dynamically changing conditions, including at mammalian CpG island promoters. Instead, rather than a major role in instructing transcription, time-resolved experiments provide more evidence supporting the deposition of H3K4me3 into chromatin as a result of transcription, influencing processes such as memory of previous states, transcriptional consistency between cells in a population and transcription termination.},

Interestingly, this region of L3mbtl2 harbors the evolutionarily conserved Pho-binding pocket also present in Drosophila Sfmbt, and mutation of the critical residues within this pocket completely abolishes its interaction with target promoters. Additionally, decreased PRC1.6 chromatin occupancy was observed following loss of individual components (L3mbtl2, Pcgf6, and Max) of the complex.

Evidence suggests that the crosstalk between histone deacetylation and histone H3K4 methylation is attributable to the ability of these HDAC inhibitors to repress the JARID1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 demethylases (H3K4DMs), including RBP2, PLU-1, SMCX, and LSD1, through the downregulation of Sp1 expression. This demonstrates the complexity of the functional roles of HDACs in the regulation of histone modifications as well as the activation of epigenetically silenced gene expression. Equally important is the ability of HDAC inhibitors to transcriptionally suppress H3K4DM gene expression which has therapeutic implications, in that several H3K4DMs such as LSD1 and PLU-1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of malignancies.}

Exposure of LNCaP prostate cancer cells and the prostate tissue of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate mice to the pan- and class I HDAC inhibitors (S)-(+)-N-hydroxy-4-(3-methyl-2-phenyl-butyrylamino)-benzamide (AR42), N-(2-aminophenyl)-4-[N-(pyridine-3-yl-methoxycarbonyl)-aminomethyl]-benzamide (MS-275), and vorinostat led to differential increases in H3K4 methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that this accumulation of methylated H3K4 occurred in conjunction with decreases in the amount of the H3K4 demethylase RBP2 at the promoter of genes associated with tumor suppression and differentiation, including KLF4 and E-cadherin. This finding, together with the HDAC inhibitor-induced up-regulation of KLF4 and E-cadherin, suggests that HDAC inhibitors could activate the expression of these genes through changes in histone methylation status. Evidence indicates that this up-regulation of H3K4 methylation was attributable to the suppressive effect of these HDAC inhibitors on the expression of RBP2 and other JARID1 family histone demethylases, including PLU-1, SMCX, and LSD1, via the down-regulation of Sp1 expression. Moreover, shRNA-mediated silencing of the class I HDAC isozymes 1, 2, 3, and 8, but not that of the class II isozyme HDAC6, mimicked the drug effects on H3K4 methylation and H3K4 demethylases, which could be reversed by ectopic Sp1 expression. These data suggest a cross-talk mechanism between HDACs and H3K4 demethylases via Sp1-mediated transcriptional regulation, which underlies the complexity of the functional role of HDACs in the regulation of histone modifications.},

  abstract = {Histone lysine methylation is a dynamic process that plays an important role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have identified Jhd2, a JmjC domain-containing protein, as an H3K4-specific demethylase in budding yeast. However, important questions regarding the regulation and functions of Jhd2 remain unanswered. In this study, we show that Jhd2 has intrinsic activity to remove all three states of H3K4 methylation in vivo and can dynamically associate with chromatin to modulate H3K4 methylation levels on both active and repressed genes and at the telomeric regions. We found that the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of Jhd2 is important for its chromatin association in vivo. However, this association is not dependent on H3K4 methylation and the H3 N-terminal tail, suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism by which Jhd2 binds nucleosomes. We also provide evidence that the JmjN domain and its interaction with the JmjC catalytic domain are important for Jhd2 function and that Not4 (an E3 ligase) monitors the structural integrity of this interdomain interaction to maintain the overall protein levels of Jhd2. We show that the S451R mutation in human SMCX (a homolog of Jhd2), which has been linked to mental retardation, and the homologous T359R mutation in Jhd2 affect the protein stability of both of these proteins. Therefore, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed defects in patients harboring this SMCX mutant and suggest the presence of a conserved pathway involving Not4 that modulates the protein stability of both yeast Jhd2 and human SMCX.},

The novel functions of LH include its role, in specific situations, as promoter of formation and growth of gonadal and extragonadal tumors. Chronically elevated LH levels in transgenic (TG) mice can also induce responses to this hormone in extragonadal tissues.

A phase of net synapse elimination occurs late in childhood, earlier in auditory cortex, where it has ended by age 12 years, than in prefrontal cortex, where it extends to midadolescence. Synaptogenesis and synapse elimination in humans appear to be heterochronous in different cortical regions and, in that respect, appears to differ from the rhesus monkey, where they are concurrent. In other respects, including overproduction of synaptic contacts in infancy, persistence of high levels of synaptic density to late childhood or adolescence, the absolute values of maximum and adult synaptic density, and layer specific differences, findings in the human resemble those in rhesus monkeys.},

  abstract = {Putting vertebrate development on hold                            Suspended animation is an often-used device in science fiction, but it also exists in several forms in nature: hibernation, torpor, and diapause. Hu               et al.               studied diapause in the African turquoise killifish, a vertebrate model system (see the Perspective by Van Gilst). They found that diapause protects a complex living organism without trade-offs for future growth, fertility, and even life span. Diapause is actively regulated, with a dynamic switch to specific Polycomb complex members. One Polycomb member, CBX7, is critical for the regulation of organ genes and is involved in muscle preservation and diapause maintenance. This work illuminates the mechanisms that underlie suspended life.

How diapause protects living organisms is largely unknown. Using the African turquoise killifish (               Nothobranchius furzeri               ), we show that diapause preserves complex organisms for extremely long periods of time without trade-offs for subsequent adult growth, fertility, and life span. Transcriptome analyses indicate that diapause is an active state, with dynamic regulation of metabolism and organ development genes. The most up-regulated genes in diapause include Polycomb complex members. The chromatin mark regulated by Polycomb, H3K27me3, is maintained at key developmental genes in diapause, and the Polycomb member CBX7 mediates repression of metabolism and muscle genes in diapause. CBX7 is functionally required for muscle preservation and diapause maintenance. Thus, vertebrate diapause is a state of suspended life that is actively maintained by specific chromatin regulators, and this has implications for long-term organism preservation.},

  abstract = {Elevated levels of gonadotropins have been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease and have been associated with poorer cognition in women, but not men. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between gonadotropins and cognition in a cohort of 585 healthy, community-dwelling men aged 70-87 years. Cognitive function was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test Second Edition (CVLT-II) and the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE). Testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and luteinizing hormone levels were assayed from early morning sera. Free testosterone was calculated using mass action equations. In linear regression analyses, neither total nor free testosterone levels were associated with measures of immediate or delayed recall. Higher levels of luteinizing hormone were associated with poorer performance on a measure of immediate recall (CVLT-II trials 1-5 total score) independent of total and free testosterone levels. The association remained after adjustment for age, educational attainment, and depression. In contrast, only total and free testosterone levels were associated with SMMSE score. These findings suggest a role for both androgens and gonadotropins in differing cognitive domains, and that gonadotropins may influence cognition independent of sex steroids.},

Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13\% of de novo missense mutations and 43\% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12\% and 9\% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30\% of all simplex and 45\% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females.},

Many chromatin-modifying enzymes and other epigenetic regulators have been genetically associated with ID disorders (IDDs). Here we review how alterations in the function of histone modifiers, chromatin remodelers, and methyl-DNA binding proteins contribute to neurodevelopmental defects and altered brain plasticity. We also discuss how progress in human genetics has led to the generation of mouse models that unveil the molecular etiology of ID, and outline the direction in which this field is moving to identify therapeutic strategies for IDDs. Importantly, because the chromatin regulators linked to IDDs often target common downstream genes and cellular processes, the impact of research in individual syndromes goes well beyond each syndrome and can also contribute to the understanding and therapy of other IDDs. Furthermore, the investigation of these disorders helps us to understand the role of chromatin regulators in brain development, plasticity, and gene expression, thereby answering fundamental questions in neurobiology.},

  abstract = {Mutations in a number of chromatin modifiers are associated with human neurological disorders. KDM5C, a histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methyl (H3K4me2/3)-specific demethylase, is frequently mutated in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) patients. Here, we report that disruption of the mouse Kdm5c gene recapitulates adaptive and cognitive abnormalities observed in XLID, including impaired social behavior, memory deficits, and aggression. Kdm5c-knockout brains exhibit abnormal dendritic arborization, spine anomalies, and altered transcriptomes. In neurons, Kdm5c is recruited to promoters that harbor CpG islands decorated with high levels of H3K4me3, where it fine-tunes H3K4me3 levels. Kdm5c predominantly represses these genes, which include members of key pathways that regulate the development and function of neuronal circuitries. In summary, our mouse behavioral data strongly suggest that KDM5C mutations are causal to XLID. Furthermore, our findings suggest that loss of KDM5C function may impact gene expression in multiple regulatory pathways relevant to the clinical phenotypes.},

Our analysis of cerebral cortex, lung, liver, and muscle transcriptomes of 16 mice, covering development and ageing intervals, revealed widespread but tissue-specific ageing-associated expression reversals. Cumulatively, these reversals create a unique phenomenon: mammalian tissue transcriptomes diverge from each other during postnatal development, but during ageing, they tend to converge towards similar expression levels, a process we term               Di               vergence followed by               Co               nvergence (DiCo). We found that DiCo was most prevalent among tissue-specific genes and associated with loss of tissue identity, which is confirmed using data from independent mouse and human datasets. Further, using publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we showed that DiCo could be driven both by alterations in tissue cell-type composition and also by cell-autonomous expression changes within particular cell types.},

Interestingly, a crosstalk between the RAS and other systems such as cholinergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic systems have been demonstrated. In this review, the preclinical and clinical evidence for the impact of RAS modulators on cognitive impairment of multiple etiologies will be discussed. In addition, the expression and function of different receptor subtypes within the RAS such as: Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), Angiotensin II type II receptor (AT2R), Angiotensin IV receptor (AT4R), Mas receptor (MasR), and Mas-related-G protein-coupled receptor (MrgD), on different cell types within the brain will be presented. We aim to direct the attention of the scientific community to the plethora of evidence on the importance of the RAS on cognition and to the different disease conditions in which these agents can be beneficial.},

While defects in gene expression and RNA metabolism have been linked with age‐associated human neuropathies, it is not clear how the changes that occur in aging neurons contribute to loss of gene expression homeostasis. R‐loops are RNA–DNA hybrids that typically form co‐transcriptionally via annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, displacing the non‐template DNA strand. Dysregulation of R‐loop homeostasis has been associated with both transcriptional impairment and genome instability. Importantly, a growing body of evidence links R‐loop accumulation with cellular dysfunction, increased cell death, and chronic disease onset. Here, we characterized the R‐loop landscape in aging               Drosophila melanogaster               photoreceptor neurons and showed that bulk R‐loop levels increased with age. Further, genome‐wide mapping of R‐loops revealed that transcribed genes accumulated R‐loops over gene bodies during aging, which correlated with decreased expression of long and highly expressed genes. Importantly, while photoreceptor‐specific down‐regulation of Top3β, a DNA/RNA topoisomerase associated with R‐loop resolution, lead to decreased visual function, over‐expression of Top3β or nuclear‐localized RNase H1, which resolves R‐loops, enhanced positive light response during aging. Together, our studies highlight the functional link between dysregulation of R‐loop homeostasis, gene expression, and visual function during aging.},

In females, one X chromosome is silenced by X inactivation, a process that is often assumed to have evolved on a broadly regional or chromosomal basis. Here we propose that genes or clusters common to both the X and Y chromosomes (X-Y genes) evolved independently along a multistep path, eventually acquiring dosage compensation on the X chromosome. Three genes studied here, and other extant genes, appear to be intermediates. ZFX, RPS4X and SMCX were monitored for X inactivation in diverse species by assaying CpG-island methylation, which mirrors X inactivation in many eutherians. ZFX evidently escaped X inactivation in proto-eutherians, which also possessed a very similar Y-linked gene; both characteristics were retained in most extant orders, but not in myomorph rodents. For RPS4X, escape from X inactivation seems unique to primates. SMCX escapes inactivation in primates and myomorphs but not in several other lineages. Thus, X inactivation can evolve independently for each of these genes. We propose that it is an adaptation to the decay of a homologous, Y-linked gene.},

  abstract = {Mental retardation is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, as more than 90 genes for this disorder has been found on the X chromosome alone. In addition the majority of patients are non-syndromic in that they do not present with clinically recognisable features. This makes it difficult to determine the molecular cause of this disorder on the basis of the phenotype alone. Mutations in KDM5C (previously named SMCX or JARID1C), a gene that encodes a transcriptional regulator with histone demethylase activity specific for dimethylated and trimethylated H3K4, are a comparatively frequent cause of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation (NS-XLMR). Specific transcriptional targets of KDM5C, however, are still unknown and the effects of KDM5C deficiency on gene expression have not yet been investigated.|By whole-mount in situ hybridisation we showed that the mouse homologue of KDM5C is expressed in multiple tissues during mouse development.We present the results of gene expression profiling performed on lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as blood from patients with mutations in KDM5C. Using whole genome expression arrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) experiments, we identified several genes, including CMKOR1, KDM5B and KIAA0469 that were consistently deregulated in both tissues.|Our findings shed light on the pathological mechanisms underlying mental retardation and have implications for future diagnostics of this heterogeneous disorder.}

  abstract = {In families with nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (NS-XLMR), {$>$}30\% of mutations seem to cluster on proximal Xp and in the pericentric region. In a systematic screen of brain-expressed genes from this region in 210 families with XLMR, we identified seven different mutations in JARID1C, including one frameshift mutation and two nonsense mutations that introduce premature stop codons, as well as four missense mutations that alter evolutionarily conserved amino acids. In two of these families, expression studies revealed the almost complete absence of the mutated JARID1C transcript, suggesting that the phenotype in these families results from functional loss of the JARID1C protein. JARID1C (Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C), formerly known as "SMCX," is highly similar to the Y-chromosomal gene JARID1D/SMCY, which encodes the H-Y antigen. The JARID1C protein belongs to the highly conserved ARID protein family. It contains several DNA-binding motifs that link it to transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, processes that are defective in various other forms of mental retardation. Our results suggest that JARID1C mutations are a relatively common cause of XLMR and that this gene might play an important role in human brain function.},

Distinct histone amino-terminal modifications can generate synergistic or antagonistic interaction affinities for chromatin-associated proteins, which in turn dictate dynamic transitions between transcriptionally active or transcriptionally silent chromatin states. The combinatorial nature of histone amino-terminal modifications thus reveals a “histone code” that considerably extends the information potential of the genetic code. We propose that this epigenetic marking system represents a fundamental regulatory mechanism that has an impact on most, if not all, chromatin-templated processes, with far-reaching consequences for cell fate decisions and both normal and pathological development.},

This article reviews the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders, which include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability and also provides updates on diagnosis, neurobiology, treatment, and issues surrounding the transition to adulthood.|Although symptoms emerge at discrete points in childhood, these disorders result from abnormal brain maturation that likely precedes clinical impairment. As a result, research has focused on the identification of predictive biological and behavioral markers, with the ultimate goal of initiating treatments that may either alter developmental trajectories or lessen clinical severity. Advances in the methods used to identify genetic variants, from chromosomal microarray analysis to whole exome sequencing, have facilitated the characterization of many genetic mutations and syndromes that share common pathways to abnormal circuit formation and brain development. Not only do genetic discoveries enrich our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical development, but they also allow us to identify more homogeneous subgroups within this spectrum of conditions. Impairments do continue into adulthood, with challenges in the transition to adulthood including the management of comorbidities and the provision of educational and vocational supports.|Advances in our understanding of the neurobiology and developmental trajectories of these disorders will pave the way for tremendous advances in treatment. Mechanism-based therapies for genetic syndromes are being studied with the goal of expanding targeted treatments to nonsyndromic forms of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification.

Recently, emerging evidence has shown that RNA modifications, which were historically considered infrastructural features of cellular RNAs, are dynamically regulated across most of the RNA species in cells and thereby critically involved in major biological processes, including cellular senescence and aging. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about RNA modifications and provide a catalog of RNA modifications on different RNA species, including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNA, tRNAs, and rRNAs. Most importantly, we focus on the regulation and roles of these RNA modifications in aging‐related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cataracts, osteoporosis, and fertility decline. This would be an important step toward a better understanding of fundamental aging mechanisms and thereby facilitating the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for aging‐related diseases.},

However, not all animals segregate their germ line in this manner. The ‘last cell standing’ model describes primordial germ cell (PGC) development in axolotls, in which PGCs are maintained by an extracellular signalling niche, and germ line commitment occurs after gastrulation. Here, we propose that this ‘stochastic’ mode of PGC specification is conserved in vertebrates, including non-rodent mammals. We postulate that early germ line segregation liberates genetic regulatory networks for somatic development to evolve, and that it therefore emerged repeatedly in the animal kingdom in response to natural selection.},

Its induction mechanism and available reporter mouse lines are based exclusively on c-fos promoter activity. Here we demonstrate that multiple enhancers surrounding the c-fos gene are crucial for ensuring robust c-fos response to various stimuli. Membrane depolarization, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and forskolin activate distinct subsets of the enhancers to induce c-fos transcription in neurons, suggesting that stimulus-specific combinatorial activation of multiple enhancers underlies the broad inducibility of the c-fos gene. Accordingly, the functional requirement of key transcription factors varies depending on the type of stimulation. Combinatorial enhancer activation also occurs in the brain. Providing a comprehensive picture of the c-fos induction mechanism beyond the minimal promoter, our study should help in understanding the physiological nature of c-fos induction in relation to neural activity and plasticity.},

  abstract = {Endothelin-1 exerts potent vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory effects through its actions on its receptors A (ETrA) and B (ETrB), respectively. While ETrA and B have classically been thought to be expressed on vascular cell types, more recent evidence suggests that, particularly following brain injury, their expression may be seen in other, non-vascular cell types. To date no studies have comprehensively studied the cellular location of endothelin receptors following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, this study investigates the cellular localization of ETrA and B in normal and traumatized brains using an impact acceleration device. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to TBI by weight drop (450 g) from either 1.5, a distance known to elicit mild TBI in the absence of changed in cerebral blood flow (CBF) or 2 m, a distance shown to cause a significant reduction in CBF. One set of impacted brains were processed for Western determination of ETrA and B expression. Another set were processed for immunofluorescence (IF). For IF, ETrA and ETrB antibodies were combined with cell markers for neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of blood vessels. While ETrA and B was upregulated after more moderate to severe injury (2 m) overall receptor expression was unchanged in response to mild trauma (1.5 m). Double labeling IF confirmed prominent ETrA and ETrB labeling in NeuN labeled pyramidal neurons and interneurons in sensorymotor cortex (smCx) and hippocampus (hipp) post TBI. ETrA rather than ETrB was preferentially co-localized in vascular smooth muscle cells. After injury, a subpopulation of astrocytes in white matter co-localized ETrA but not ETrB. Localization of either receptor in endothelial cells was sparse. No prominent IF was detected in microglia and oligodendrocytes. Taken together with previous findings in other pathological states that show an apparent shift in the localization of ETrA and B, the observed receptor shifts in this work may underlie the ET-1-mediated pathotrajectory of TBI including hypoperfusion.},

The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression.

Biochemical studies showed that many PcG proteins are present in two protein complexes, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2, which repress transcription via chromatin modifications. TrxG proteins activate transcription via a variety of mechanisms. Here we summarize the large body of genetic and biochemical experiments in Drosophila on these two important groups of genes.},

  abstract = {Mammalian sex chromosomes originated from a pair of autosomes, and homologous genes on the sex chromosomes (gametologs) differentiated through recombination arrest between the chromosomes. It was hypothesized that this differentiation in eutherians took place in a stepwise fashion and left a footprint on the X chromosome termed "evolutionary strata." The evolutionary stratum hypothesis claims that strata 1 and 2 (which correspond to the first two steps of chromosomal differentiation) were generated in the stem lineage of Theria or before the divergence between eutherians and marsupials. However, this prediction relied solely on the molecular clock hypothesis between pairs of human gametologs, and molecular evolution of marsupial sex chromosomal genes has not yet been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the following 7 pairs of marsupial gametologs, together with their eutherian orthologs that reside in stratum 1 or 2: SOX3/SRY, RBMX/Y, RPS4X/Y, HSFX/Y, XKRX/Y, SMCX/Y (KDM5C/D, JARID1C/D), and UBE1X/Y (UBA1/UBA1Y). Phylogenetic analyses and estimated divergence time of these gametologs reveal that they all differentiated at the same time in the therian ancestor. We have also provided strong evidence for gene conversion that occurred in the 3' region of the eutherian stratum 2 genes (SMCX/Y and UBE1X/Y). The results of the present study show that (1) there is no compelling evidence for the second stratum in the stem lineage of Theria; (2) gene conversion, which may have occurred between SMCX/Y and UBE1X/Y in the eutherian lineage, potentially accounts for their apparently lower degree of overall divergence.},

In this study we set out to find the site of the proboscipedia (pb) locus. In order to accomplish this, four new alleles of this homeotic gene were induced with gamma rays. Genetic and cytogenetic analyses have shown that the pb locus resides in polytene chromosome bands 84A1-6, immediately adjacent to the Antp gene complex in 84B1-2. An analysis of the morphology of the proboscis and the dose relationships of the four new alleles have shown that this homeosis is unusual in at least two respects. First, the two different developmental fates realized in the proboscis at 18 degrees (labial palps –{$>$} arista) and 29 degrees (labial palps –{$>$} leg) under the influence of pb(1) grown at 18 degrees , while the remaining three are like pb(1) at 29 degrees . Dosage studies reveal that this difference reflects a hypomorphic vs. amorphic condition. Second, like the original, these new alleles produce a prothoracic rather than a mesothoracic leg in the proboscis. Both of these results indicate that pb is unique among the homeotics, and as such it may offer some new insights into developmental processes.}

  abstract = {In mammals, germ cells produce a class of small regulatory RNAs called PIWI-interacting RNAs or piRNAs, which are 25–32 nucleotides in length. The profile of testicular piRNAs changes during development. The piRNAs detected in fetal testes at embryonic day 13.5 and later are called fetal piRNAs. The piRNAs detected in testes in a period where germ cells do not yet enter the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I are called pre-pachytene piRNAs, whereas those in testes at later postnatal days are called pachytene piRNAs. Here, to elucidate the exact expression dynamics of these piRNAs during development, we compared piRNAs present in male germ cells at different stages, which were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and those in embryonic testes. The analysis identified three distinct groups of piRNA clusters: prospermatogonial, early, and late clusters. piRNA length was largely correlated with the repertoire of PIWI-like proteins in respective germ cells; however, the late piRNA clusters tended to generate longer (PIWIL1-type) piRNAs, whereas the early clusters tended to generate shorter (PIWIL2-type) piRNAs, suggesting a cluster- or sequence-dependent mechanism for loading onto PIWI-like proteins. Retrotransposon-derived piRNAs, particularly evolutionary young retrotransposons, were abundantly produced in prospermatogonia, however, their abundance declined as development proceeded. Thus, in later stages, retrotransposon-derived piRNAs were not enriched with those from evolutionary young elements. The results revealed that, depending on the piRNA clusters from which they are derived, longer PIWIL1-type piRNAs are produced earlier, and shorter PIWIL2-type piRNAs remain in a longer period, than previously thought.},

Ciliary ultrastructure is complex, consisting of nine parallel microtubules doublets, with or without motor dynein arms and a central pair of microtubules. Classification of cilia has evolved over time, and currently, four main classes are described: motile and non-motile cilia with a "9 + 2" structure, and motile and non-motile cilia with a "9 + 0" structure, which depend on the presence or absence of dynein arms and a central pair. Ciliopathies are inherited multisystem disorders of cilia, and may present with a varied spectrum of genotypes and phenotypes. Motor and sensory ciliopathies were historically considered as distinct dysfunctions of motile and non-motile cilia, but recent data indicate that the classical features of motor and sensory cilia may overlap.},

  abstract = {Cytogenetic and molecular deletion analyses of azoospermic and oligozoospermic males have suggested the existence of AZoospermia Factor(s) (AZF) residing in deletion intervals 5 and 6 of the human Y-chromosome and coinciding with three functional regions associated with spermatogenic failure. Nonpolymorphic microdeletions in AZF are associated with a broad spectrum of testicular phenotypes. Unfortunately, Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs) employed in screening protocols range broadly in number and mapsite and may be polymorphic. To thoroughly analyze the AZF region(s) and any correlations that may be drawn between genotype and phenotype, we describe the design of nine multiplex PCR reactions derived from analysis of 136 loci. Each multiplex contains 4-8 STS primer pairs, amplifying a total of 48 Y-linked STSs. Each multiplex consists of one positive control: either SMCX or MIC2. We screened four populations of males with these STSs. Population I consisted of 278 patients diagnosed as having significant male factor infertility: either azoospermia, severe oligozoospermia associated with hypogonadism and spermatogenic arrest or normal sperm counts associated with abnormal sperm morphology. Population II consisted of 200 unselected infertile patients. Population III consisted of 36 patients who had previously been shown to have aneuploidy, cytological deletions or translocations involving the Y-chromosome or normal karyotypes associated with severe phenotype abnormalities. Population IV consisted of 920 fertile (control) males. The deletion rates in populations I, II and III were 20.5\%, 7\% and 58.3\%, respectively. A total of 92 patients with deletions were detected. The deletion rate in population IV was 0.87\% involving 8 fertile individuals and 4 STSs which were avoided in multiplex panel construction. The ability of the nine multiplexes to detect pathology associated microdeletions is equal to or greater than screening protocols used in other studies. Furthermore, the data suggest a fourth AZF region between AZFb and AZFc, which we have termed AZFd. Patients with microdeletions restricted to AZFd may present with mild oligozoospermia or even normal sperm counts associated with abnormal sperm morphology. Though a definitive genotype/phenotype correlation does not exist, large deletions spanning multiple AZF regions or microdeletions restricted to AZFa usually result in patients with Sertoli Cell Only (SCO) or severe oligozoospermia, whereas microdeletions restricted to AZFb or AZFc can result in patients with phenotypes which range from SCO to moderate oligozoospermia. The panel of nine multiplexed reactions, the Y-deletion Detection System (YDDS), provides a fast, efficient and accurate method of assessing the integrity of the Y-chromosome. To date, this study provides the most extensive screening of a proven fertile male population in tandem with 514 infertile males, derived from three different patient selection protocols.},

Here, we perform bisulfite sequencing of the blood of\,{$>$}\,100 NMRs, assessing\,{$>$}\,3 million common CpG sites. Unsupervised clustering based on sites whose methylation correlates with age reveals an age-related methylome remodeling, and we also observe a methylome information loss, suggesting that NMRs age. We develop an epigenetic aging clock that accurately predicts the NMR age. We show that these animals age much slower than mice and much faster than humans, consistent with their known maximum lifespans.

  abstract = {Long-term treatments to ameliorate peripheral neuropathic pain that includes mechanical allodynia are limited. While glial activation and altered nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord are associated with the pathogenesis of mechanical allodynia, changes in cortical circuits also accompany peripheral nerve injury and may represent additional therapeutic targets. Dendritic spine plasticity in the S1 cortex appears within days following nerve injury; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms of this plasticity and whether it has a causal relationship to allodynia remain unsolved. Furthermore, it is not known whether glial activation occurs within the S1 cortex following injury or whether it contributes to this S1 synaptic plasticity. Using in vivo 2-photon imaging with genetic and pharmacological manipulations of murine models, we have shown that sciatic nerve ligation induces a re-emergence of immature metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling in S1 astroglia, which elicits spontaneous somatic Ca2+ transients, synaptogenic thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) release, and synapse formation. This S1 astrocyte reactivation was evident only during the first week after injury and correlated with the temporal changes in S1 extracellular glutamate levels and dendritic spine turnover. Blocking the astrocytic mGluR5-signaling pathway suppressed mechanical allodynia, while activating this pathway in the absence of any peripheral injury induced long-lasting ({$>$}1 month) allodynia. We conclude that reawakened astrocytes are a key trigger for S1 circuit rewiring and that this contributes to neuropathic mechanical allodynia.},

  abstract = {SMCX/JARID1C was recently shown to be a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase. Here, we have identified an SMCX isoform that predominantly resides in the cytoplasm, but still efficiently demethylates trimethylated H3K4. SMCX requires several functional domains for its demethylase activity and is also capable of forming homomers through amino acids 204-493. Further, SMCX physically interacts with Smad3, a mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and overexpression of SMCX inhibits the ability of Smad3 to activate transcription. Thus, SMCX is a novel Smad3 corepressor that may antagonize the tumor suppressing activity of the TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling pathway and thereby contribute to tumorigenesis. Indeed, SMCX is overexpressed in prostate tumors and seminomas, suggesting that SMCX might be a novel oncogene.},

This indicates that haploinsufficiency of Eu-HMTase1 is responsible for the 9q submicroscopic subtelomeric deletion syndrome. This observation was further supported by the spatio-temporal expression of the gene. Using tissue in situ hybridisation studies in mouse embryos and adult brain, Eu-HMTase1 was shown to be expressed in the developing nervous system and in specific peripheral tissues. While expression is selectively downregulated in adult brain, substantial expression is retained in the olfactory bulb, anterior/ventral lateral ventricular wall, and hippocampus and weakly in the piriform cortex.|The expression pattern of this gene suggests a role in the CNS development and function, which is in line with the severe mental retardation and behaviour problems in patients who lack one copy of the gene.},

We have performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations reminiscent of 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. This analysis revealed three additional microdeletions that comprise the EHMT1 gene, including one interstitial deletion that reduces the critical region for this syndrome. Most importantly, we identified two de novo mutations–a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation–in the EHMT1 gene in patients with a typical 9q- phenotype.

The clinical phenotype is characterized by progressive weakness, atrophy, and sensory abnormalities that are most pronounced in the distal extremities. Some patients have CNS manifestations. Affected males have moderate to severe symptoms, whereas heterozygous females are usually less affected. Neurophysiology shows intermediate slowing of conduction and length-dependent axonal loss. Nerve biopsies show more prominent axonal degeneration than de/remyelination. Mutations in GJB1, the gene that encodes the gap junction (GJ) protein connexin32 (Cx32) cause CMT1X; more than 400 different mutations have been described. Many Cx32 mutants fail to form functional GJs, or form GJs with abnormal biophysical properties. Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes express Cx32, and the GJs formed by Cx32 play an important role in the homeostasis of myelinated axons. Animal models of CMT1X demonstrate that loss of Cx32 in myelinating Schwann cells causes a demyelinating neuropathy. Effective therapies remain to be developed.

  abstract = {Abstract           Genetic changes that modify the function of transcriptional enhancers have been linked to the evolution of biological diversity across species. Multiple studies have focused on the role of nucleotide substitutions, transposition, and insertions and deletions in altering enhancer function. Here we show that turnover of CpG islands (CGIs), which contribute to enhancer activation, is broadly associated with changes in enhancer activity across mammals, including humans. We integrated maps of CGIs and enhancer activity-associated histone modifications obtained from multiple tissues in nine mammalian species and found that CGI content in enhancers was strongly associated with increased histone modification levels. CGIs showed widespread turnover across species and species-specific CGIs were strongly enriched for enhancers exhibiting species-specific activity across all tissues and species we examined. Genes associated with enhancers with species-specific CGIs showed concordant biases in their expression, supporting that CGI turnover contributes to gene regulatory innovation. Our results also implicate CGI turnover in the evolution of Human Gain Enhancers (HGEs), which show increased activity in human embryonic development and may have contributed to the evolution of uniquely human traits. Using a humanized mouse model, we show that a highly conserved HGE with a large CGI absent from the mouse ortholog shows increased activity at the human CGI in the humanized mouse diencephalon. Collectively, our results point to CGI turnover as a mechanism driving gene regulatory changes potentially underlying trait evolution in mammals.},

This physicochemical stability was maintained in the biological activities of MK to enhance plasminogen activator (PA) activity in bovine endothelial cells as well as to promote neurite outgrowth of rat brain cells. A similar stability was observed both with recombinant murine MK and with its homologous protein, recombinant human pleiotrophin.

In mice, retinoic acid (RA), the extrinsic signal for meiotic initiation, activates transcription of Stra8, which is required for meiotic DNA replication and the subsequent processes of meiotic prophase. Here we report that RA also activates transcription of Rec8, which encodes a component of the cohesin complex that accumulates during meiotic S phase, and which is essential for chromosome synapsis and segregation. This RA induction of Rec8 occurs in parallel with the induction of Stra8, and independently of Stra8 function, and it is conserved between the sexes. Further, RA induction of Rec8, like that of Stra8, requires the germ-cell-intrinsic competence factor Dazl. Our findings strengthen the importance of RA and Dazl in the meiotic transition, provide important details about the Stra8 pathway, and open avenues to investigate early meiosis through analysis of Rec8 induction and function.},

  abstract = {In mammals, meiosis is initiated at different time points in males and females, but the mechanism underlying this difference is unknown. Female germ cells begin meiosis during embryogenesis. In males, embryonic germ cells undergo G               0               /G               1               mitotic cell cycle arrest, and meiosis begins after birth. In mice, the               Stimulated by Retinoic Acid Gene 8               (               Stra8               ) has been found to be required for the transition into meiosis in both female and male germ cells.               Stra8               is expressed in embryonic ovaries just before meiotic initiation, whereas its expression in testes is first detected after birth. Here we examine the mechanism underlying the sex-specific timing of               Stra8               expression and meiotic initiation in mice. Our work shows that signaling by retinoic acid (RA), an active derivative of vitamin A, is required for               Stra8               expression and thereby meiotic initiation in embryonic ovaries. We also discovered that RA is sufficient to induce               Stra8               expression in embryonic testes and in vitamin A-deficient adult testes               in vivo               . Finally, our results show that cytochrome p450 (CYP)-mediated RA metabolism prevents premature               Stra8               expression in embryonic testes. Treatment with an inhibitor specific to RA-metabolizing enzymes indicates that a cytochrome p450 from the 26 family (CYP26) is responsible for delaying               Stra8               expression in embryonic testes. Sex-specific regulation of RA signaling thus plays an essential role in meiotic initiation in embryonic ovaries and precludes its occurrence in embryonic testes. Because RA signaling regulates               Stra8               expression in both embryonic ovaries and adult testes, this portion of the meiotic initiation pathway may be identical in both sexes.},

  abstract = {Our laboratory has previously shown that endothelin 1 (ET-1), a powerful vasoconstrictor, and its receptors, A (ETrA) and B (ETrB), are up-regulated following trauma. This up-regulation coincides temporally with enhanced vasoreactivity in cerebral cortical microvessels, which leads to a state of chronic hypoperfusion for up to 48 hours following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the direct contribution of either receptor up-regulation to decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) after closed head trauma has not been determined. Furthermore, how ET-1 blockade may affect histological outcome following TBI has not been explored. Therefore, the effects of ETrA and B antagonism on TBI induced hypoperfusion of CBF and cell injury in sensorimotor cortex (smCx) and hippocampus (Hipp) were assessed by arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging and Fluoro-Jade staining, respectively.|Adult male rats were given intracerebroventricular injections of ETrA (BQ123) or ETrB antagonist (BQ788) before being subjected to TBI using a closed head acceleration impact model. Following TBI, CBF was measured and histological examination of cell integrity was carried out.|ETrA blockade ameliorated TBI induced hypoperfusion in smCx and Hipp at 4 and 24 hours after TBI and caused a mild hyperemia in both centers by 48 hours after injury. Furthermore, ETrA antagonism reduced the extent of Fluoro-Jade labeled cells within smCx and Hipp as compared with TBI only. ETrB blockade had little effect on TBI induced hypoperfusion and did not change the extent of cell injury following TBI.|These results suggest that decreased CBF following TBI may be caused by ETrA, but not ETrB, up-regulation. Furthermore, these results suggest that TBI induced hypoperfusion may contribute to poor neurologic outcome following TBI. In this work, we provide a rationale for studying the clinical relevancy of use of ETrA antagonists following TBI.},

  abstract = {Microdialysis sampling combined with HPLC was used to assess spontaneous and d-amphetamine (AMPH)-evoked release of noradrenaline (NA) in the cerebellum 1 day after probe implantation and 1 day after contusion of the right sensorimotor cortex (SMCX) in rats. In normal controls the mean +/- SEM basal NA release was 10.08 +/- 0.97 pg in the left cerebellar hemisphere and 8.21 +/- 1.17 pg in the right hemisphere 22-24 h after probe implantation. The average +/- SEM NA release in a 3-h period after administration of AMPH (2 mg/kg, i.p.) increased to 453 +/- 47.35 pg in the left and to 402 +/- 49.95 pg in the right cerebellar hemisphere. NA release (range of 413-951\% increase over baseline) was maximal 20-40 min postdrug, returned to basal levels within 5 h, and remained unchanged for the 22-24-h postdrug measurement period. Animals with a focal SMCX contusion had a marked depression of both spontaneous and AMPH-evoked NA release. Mean +/- SEM basal NA release was 4.84 +/- 1.09 pg in the left and 4.95 +/- 0.43 pg in the right cerebellar hemisphere from 22 to 24 h postinjury, with NA levels increasing to 259 +/- 75.44 and 219 +/- 23.45 pg in the respective hemispheres over a 3-h period after AMPH. The maximal AMPH-induced increase in NA release ranged from 522 to 1,088\% of basal levels in contused rats, with NA release returning to predrug levels within 5 h and remaining depressed for at least 48 h postinjury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Here, we quantitatively delineate chromatin dynamics during induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and from there into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), revealing large-scale reorganization of chromatin signatures including H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 patterns. EpiLCs contain abundant bivalent gene promoters characterized by low H3K27me3, indicating a state primed for differentiation. PGCLCs initially lose H3K4me3 from many bivalent genes but subsequently regain this mark with concomitant upregulation of H3K27me3, particularly at developmental regulatory genes. PGCLCs progressively lose H3K9me2, including at lamina-associated perinuclear heterochromatin, resulting in changes in nuclear architecture. T recruits H3K27ac to activate BLIMP1 and early mesodermal programs during PGCLC specification, which is followed by BLIMP1-mediated repression of a broad range of targets, possibly through recruitment and spreading of H3K27me3. These findings provide a foundation for reconstructing regulatory networks of the germline epigenome.},

Development of the neocortex requires the orchestrated execution of a series of crucial processes, including the migration of young neurons into appropriate positions within the nascent neocortex, and the acquisition of layer-specific neuronal identities and axonal projections. Here, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the notion that the migration and final laminar positioning of cortical neurons are also co-regulated by cell type- and layer-specific transcription factors that play concomitant roles in determining the molecular identity and axonal connectivity of these neurons. These transcriptional programs thus provide direct links between the mechanisms controlling the laminar position and identity of cortical neurons.},

Here we show by in vitro and in vivo analyses that MeCP2 binding to non-CG methylated sites in brain is largely confined to the tri-nucleotide sequence mCAC. MeCP2 binding to chromosomal DNA in mouse brain is proportional to mCAC + mCG density and unexpectedly defines large genomic domains within which transcription is sensitive to MeCP2 occupancy.

The ages of individual X-Y gene pairs (measured by nucleotide divergence) and the locations of their X members on the X chromosome were found to be highly correlated. Age decreased in stepwise fashion from the distal long arm to the distal short arm in at least four “evolutionary strata.” Human sex chromosome evolution was probably punctuated by at least four events, each suppressing X-Y recombination in one stratum, without disturbing gene order on the X chromosome. The first event, which marked the beginnings of X-Y differentiation, occurred about 240 to 320 million years ago, shortly after divergence of the mammalian and avian lineages.},

  abstract = {Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is synthesized by the combined action of three metabolic pathways, namely de novo synthesis, recycling, and salvage pathways. The best-known function of BH4 is its mandatory action as a natural cofactor of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases. Thus, BH4 is essential for the synthesis of nitric oxide, a retrograde neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. We investigated the effect of BH4 (4-4000 pmol) intracerebroventricular administration on aversive memory, and on BH4 metabolism in the hippocampus of rodents. Memory-related behaviors were assessed in Swiss and C57BL/6 J mice, and in Wistar rats. It was consistently observed across all rodent species that BH4 facilitates aversive memory acquisition and consolidation by increasing the latency to step-down in the inhibitory avoidance task. This effect was associated with a reduced threshold to generate hippocampal long-term potentiation process. In addition, two inhibitors of memory formation (N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester - L-Name - and dizocilpine - MK-801 -) blocked the enhanced effect of BH4 on memory, while the amnesic effect was not rescue by the co-administration of BH4 or a cGMP analog (8-Br-cGMP). The data strongly suggest that BH4 enhances aversive memory by activating the glutamatergic neurotransmission and the retrograde activity of NO. It was also demonstrated that BH2 can be converted into BH4 by activating the BH4 salvage pathway under physiological conditions in the hippocampus. This is the first evidence showing that BH4 enhances aversive memory and that the BH4 salvage pathway is active in the hippocampus.},

We demonstrate that H3K4me3-TAF3 interactions direct global TFIID recruitment to active genes, some of which are p53 targets. Further analyses show that (1) H3K4me3 enhances p53-dependent transcription by stimulating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation; (2) H3K4me3, through TAF3 interactions, can act either independently or cooperatively with the TATA box to direct PIC formation and transcription; and (3) H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions regulate gene-selective functions of p53 in response to genotoxic stress. Our findings indicate a mechanism by which H3K4me3 directs PIC assembly for the rapid induction of specific p53 target genes.},

It is a potent biological mediator that modulates the activity of numerous cell types, including various neuronal populations, platelets, neutrophils and mast cells, and smooth muscle cells in bronchi and vasculature. Most of these effects help to protect cells and tissues during stress conditions such as ischaemia. Adenosine mediates its effects through four receptor subtypes: the A1, A2a, A2b and A3 receptors. The A2a receptor (A2aR) is abundant in basal ganglia, vasculature and platelets, and stimulates adenylyl cyclase. It is a major target of caffeine, the most widely used psychoactive drug. Here we investigate the role of the A2a receptor by disrupting the gene in mice. We found that A2aR-knockout (A2aR-/-) mice were viable and bred normally. Their exploratory activity was reduced, whereas caffeine, which normally stimulates exploratory behaviour, became a depressant of exploratory activity. Knockout animals scored higher in anxiety tests, and male mice were much more aggressive towards intruders. The response of A2aR-/- mice to acute pain stimuli was slower. Blood pressure and heart rate were increased, as well as platelet aggregation. The specific A2a agonist CGS 21680 lost its biological activity in all systems tested.},

We have isolated a new member of the p21CIP1/p27KIP1 CDI family and named it p57KIP2 to denote its apparent molecular mass and higher similarity to p27KIP1. Three distinct p57 cDNAs were cloned that differ at the start of their open reading frames and correspond to messages generated by the use of distinct splice acceptor sites. p57 is distinguished from p21 and p27 by its unique domain structure. Four distinct domains follow the heterogeneous amino-terminal region and include, in order, a p21/p27-related CDK inhibitory domain, a proline-rich (28\% proline) domain, an acidic (36\% glutamic or aspartic acid) domain, and a carboxy-terminal nuclear targeting domain that contains a putative CDK phosphorylation site and has sequence similarity to p27 but not to p21. Most of the acidic domain consists of a novel, tandemly repeated 4-amino acid motif. p57 is a potent inhibitor of G1- and S-phase CDKs (cyclin E-cdk2, cyclin D2-cdk4, and cyclin A-cdk2) and, to lesser extent, of the mitotic cyclin B-Cdc2. In mammalian cells, p57 localizes to the nucleus, associates with G1 CDK components, and its overexpression causes a complete cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. In contrast to the widespread expression of p21 and p27 in human tissues, p57 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, as a 1.5-kb species in placenta and at lower levels in various other tissues and a 7-kb mRNA species observed in skeletal muscle and heart. The expression pattern and unique domain structure of p57 suggest that this CDI may play a specialized role in cell cycle control.},

However, the methyltransferases responsible for H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive. Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression is unclear. In this study, we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of Mll4 markedly decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Mediator and Polymerase II levels on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Together, these findings identify MLL4 as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.

Because it can be retained through cell divisions, transcriptional memory allows cells to coordinate complex transcriptional programs during development.

In this review, we discuss the consequences of failure to reprogram histone methylation during three crucial epigenetic reprogramming windows: maternal reprogramming at fertilization, embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, and the continuous maintenance of cell identity in differentiated cells. In addition, we discuss how following the wrong breadcrumb trail of transcriptional memory provides a framework for understanding how heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in histone-modifying enzymes may cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {Sister chromatid cohesion is maintained from DNA replication to metaphase-to-anaphase transition by multisubunit protein complexes called cohesin, which include at least four proteins, SMC1alpha, SMC3, Rad21 and either SA1 or SA2, in mammalian somatic cells. We report here the first evidence of the involvement of Rec8 protein, a mammalian homolog of yeast Rec8p, in meiosis-specific chromosome behavior in mammals. In immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis using specific antibodies against mouse Rec8, we found that Rec8 was expressed in the testis but not in the kidney or liver; more precisely, it was expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids but not in spermatogonia or other somatic cells. We also found that Rec8 is present in both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states in vivo. Immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that Rec8 associates with other cohesin proteins, SMC1beta (meiosis-specific protein) and SMC3 and with a component of synaptonemal complexes, SCP3, but not with SMC1alpha. In meiotic chromosome spreads, Rec8 was localized along the axial/lateral elements of the synaptonemal complexes in meiotic prophase from the leptotene to diplotene stages. At later stages, diakinesis and metaphase I, Rec8 was localized along the interstitial axes of chromosomes, including both centromere and arm regions of chromosomes. However, concomitantly with separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I, Rec8 was no longer detected along the arm regions, while it persisted on centromere regions up to metaphase II. In anaphase II, the centromeric signals were diminished. We propose from these results that mammalian Rec8 protein, in association with SMC3 and SMC1beta but not SMC1alpha, is involved in meiosis-specific chromosome behavior, and that homologous chromosome separation is triggered by selective loss of Rec8 from chromosome arms in meiosis I, while sister chromatid cohesion is maintained until metaphase II/anaphase II transition by centromeric Rec8 during mammalian meiosis.},

  abstract = {Tryptophan is mainly metabolized in the brain through methoxyindole and kynurenine pathways. The methoxyindole pathway produces (among other compounds) melatonin, which displays inhibitory effects on human and animal central nervous systems, including a significant attenuation of excitatory, glutamate-mediated responses. The kynurenine pathway produces kynurenines that interact with brain glutamate-mediated responses. Nitric oxide (NO) increases glutamate release, and melatonin and kynurenines may act via modification of NO synthesis. In the present study, the effects of melatonin and four synthetic kynurenines were studied on the activity of rat striatal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and on the response of rat striatal neurons to sensorimotor cortex (SMCx) stimulation, a glutamate-mediated response. Melatonin inhibited both NOS activity and the striatal glutamate response, and these effects were dose-related. Compound A (2-acetamide-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid) did not inhibit NOS activity but inhibited the striatal response similarly to melatonin. Compound B (2-acetamide-4-(2-amino-5-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid) was more potent than melatonin in inhibiting both NOS activity and the striatal response. Compound C (2-butyramide-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid) did not change NOS activity, but increased the striatal response. Compound D (2-butyramide-4-(2-amino-5-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid) showed potent inhibitory effects on both NOS activity and striatal glutamate-mediated response. A structure-related effect of the kynurenine derivatives was observed, and those with an amino group in position 2 of the benzenic ring had more potent effects than melatonin itself in inhibiting striatal NOS activity and the response of striatal neurons to SMCx.},

  abstract = {Melatonin attenuates the excitatory response of striatal neurons to sensorimotor cortex (SMCx) stimulation, which may be the basis for its neuroprotective role. Searching for new compounds with melatonin-like properties, the effects of several kynurenine derivatives in the response of the rat striatum to SMCx stimulation were studied using electrophysiological and microiontophoretical techniques. Melatonin iontophoresis (-100 nA) significantly attenuated the striatal excitatory response in 89.4\% of the recorded neurons, showing excitatory properties in the other 10.6\%. Compound A [2-acetamide-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid] (-100 nA) displayed similar attenuating effects (86.7\% of neurons inhibited vs. 13.3\% excited). Compound B [2-acetamide-4-(2-amine-5-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid] (-100 nA) was more potent than melatonin itself to attenuate the excitatory response in 100\% of the recorded neurons. Compound C [2-butyramide-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid] (-100 nA) significantly increased the excitatory response in 84.2\% of the recorded neurons, showing attenuating effects on the other 15.8\% of the neurons. Interestingly, compound C iontophoresis excited the neurons in which melatonin had attenuating properties, whereas it inhibited the neurons showing excitatory responses to melatonin. These data suggest melatonin inverse agonist properties for compound C. Also, the effects of compounds B and C appeared immediately after they were iontophoretized, whereas both melatonin and compound A onset latencies were longer (2-4 min). The lack of latency shown by these melatonin analogs points to the possibility that melatonin itself was metabolized before producing its effects on striatal neurons. The results show a family of structurally-related melatonin analogs that may open new perspectives in search for new neuroprotective agents, including its clinical potentiality.},

  abstract = {Tau aggregates contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although RNA promotes tau aggregation in vitro, whether tau aggregates in cells contain RNA is unknown. We demonstrate, in cell culture and mouse brains, that cytosolic and nuclear tau aggregates contain RNA with enrichment for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Nuclear tau aggregates colocalize with and alter the composition, dynamics, and organization of nuclear speckles, membraneless organelles involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, several nuclear speckle components, including SRRM2, mislocalize to cytosolic tau aggregates in cells, mouse brains, and brains of individuals with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Consistent with these alterations, we observe that the presence of tau aggregates is sufficient to alter pre-mRNA splicing. This work identifies tau alteration of nuclear speckles as a feature of tau aggregation that may contribute to the pathology of tau aggregates.},

Unlike MeCP1, the new protein is able to bind to DNA that contains a single methyl-CpG pair. By staining with an antibody, we show that the distribution of MeCP2 along the chromosomes parallels that of methyl-CpG. In mouse, for example, MeCP2 is concentrated in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which contains a large fraction (about 40\%) of all genomic 5-methylcytosine.},

It is still unclear whether the majority of piRNA factors expressed in spermatids are involved in long interspersed nuclear element-1 repression after meiosis, but future conditional knockout research is expected to resolve this. In addition, recent hamster knockout studies showed that a piRNA factor is necessary for oocytes-in complete contrast to the findings in mice.

Several piRNA pathway components localize to the unique, germline structure known as the nuage. In this study, we surveyed mouse ovaries and found, for the first time, transient appearance of nuage-like structures in oocytes of primordial follicles. Mouse vasa homolog (MVH), Piwi-like 2 (PIWIL2/MILI) and tudor domain-containing 9 (TDRD9) are present in these structures, whereas aggregates of germ cell protein with ankyrin repeats, sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper (GASZ) localize separately in the cytoplasm.

In mice, Dazl mRNA is first observed at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), but previous studies using Dazl-deficient mice of mixed genetic background have largely emphasized postnatal spermatogenic defects. Using an inbred C57BL/6 background, we show that Dazl is required for embryonic development and survival of XY germ cells. By E14.5, expression of germ cell markers (Mvh, Oct4, Dppa3/Stella, GCNA and MVH protein) was reduced in XY Dazl-/- gonads. By E15.5, most remaining germ cells in XY Dazl-/- embryos exhibited apoptotic morphology, and XY Dazl-/- gonads contained increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells. The rare XY Dazl-/- germ cells that persisted until birth maintained a nuclear morphology that resembled that of wildtype germ cells at E12.5-E13.5, a critical developmental period when XY germ cells lose pluripotency and commit to a spermatogonial fate. We propose that Dazl is required as early as E12.5-E13.5, shortly after its expression is first detected, and that inbred Dazl-/- mice of C57BL/6 background provide a reproducible standard for exploring Dazl's roles in embryonic germ cell development.},

  abstract = {Both DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications contribute to gene silencing, but the mechanistic relationship between these epigenetic marks is unclear. Mutations in two Arabidopsis genes, the KRYPTONITE (KYP) histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase and the CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) DNA methyltransferase, cause a reduction of CNG DNA methylation, suggesting that H3K9 methylation controls CNG DNA methylation. Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and immunohistolocalization experiments, we found that H3K27 methylation colocalizes with H3K9 methylation at CMT3-controlled loci. The H3K27 methylation present at heterochromatin was not affected by mutations in KYP or in several Arabidopsis PcG related genes including the Enhancer of Zeste homologs, suggesting that a novel pathway controls heterochromatic H3K27 methylation. Our results suggest a model in which H3K9 methylation by KYP, and H3K27 methylation by an unknown enzyme provide a combinatorial histone code for the recruitment of CMT3 to silent loci.},

However, RA acts too widely in mammalian development to account, by itself, for the cell-type and temporal specificity of meiotic initiation. We considered parallels to yeast, in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to restrict meiotic initiation. We demonstrate that, in mouse embryos, extrinsic and intrinsic factors together regulate meiotic initiation. The mouse RNA-binding protein DAZL, which is expressed by postmigratory germ cells, is a key intrinsic factor, enabling those cells to initiate meiosis in response to RA. Within a brief developmental window,               Dazl               -expressing germ cells in both XX and XY embryos actively acquire the ability to interpret RA as a meiosis-inducing signal.},

Histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me) are both associated with the chromatin of gene-silenced regions in the X chromosome and with X inactivation. Studies have shown that H3K9me is supposedly an early mark on the X chromosome during inactivation. Here, we examined the distribution and enrichment profiles of H3K9me and H3K27me by indirect immunofluorescence. We found that H3K9me appears to have a broad distribution throughout the whole genome, but is specific, to a certain extent, to the Xi in WI38 cells. In contrast, H3K27me is highly specific to the entire Xi, which differs significantly from other areas of the nucleus. Thus, H3K27me is more suitable as an epigenetic mark than H3K9me. The chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses also showed that H3K27me predominates on the inactive genes of the X chromosome. Additionally, we compared the levels of H3K9me and H3K27me in four X-linked genes and two autosomal genes between the normal cells (WI38) and the tumor cells (HeLa). The results revealed that the methylation levels of the inactive genes (POLA and OCRL) in tumor cells (HeLa) were lower than those in normal cells (WI38) and that the methylation levels of the Xi inactivation-avoidance genes (SMCX and ZFX) and autosomal genes (Myc and β-actin) varied widely in tumor cells (HeLa). These events may be significant for cancer cell development and contribute to the characteristics of tumor cells.},

Mechanistically, loss of KDM5C impairs the bioenergetic metabolism, resulting in impaired osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with the KDM5 inhibitor reduces osteoclastogenesis and energy metabolism of both female mice and human monocytes.

Using an in vitro model of bicuculline-induced epileptiform activity, we asked whether increased connexin levels occur during epileptiform activity in the intact whole hippocampus, freshly isolated from young (15-day-old) mouse brain. Exposure to bicuculline (10 microM), for 2-10 h, induced persistent changes in electrical activities that included enhanced spontaneous field activity (4 h), an epileptiform response to single electrical stimulation (6 h), and spontaneous epileptiform activity (6 h). These electrophysiological changes were not reversed by up to 60 min perfusion with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid, but were greatly depressed by the gap junction uncoupler, carbenoxolone (120 microM, 10 min). Data from RNase protection assay and immunoblotting showed that among several detected gap junctions, only connexin 32 was affected. After 2-6 h exposure to bicuculline, the connexin 32 mRNA expression was upregulated to 2-3-fold control (P {$<$} 0.01), and its protein level was significantly elevated the following 6 h (P {$<$} 0.01), at which time electrophysiologically measured evidence of clearly epileptiform activity was apparent. In addition, the transcription factor, c-fos protein, but not the cAMP response element-binding protein, was also found to be increased at the early stage of bicuculline exposure (2 h) compared to control (P {$<$} 0.05).Thus, we have found that exposing the acutely isolated hippocampus to bicuculline, induced increased c-fos protein, followed by increased connexin 32 transcript and protein, and concurrently, persistent epileptiform activity that was depressed by carbenoxolone.},

Both methylated CG (mCG)- and mCH (H = A, C, or T)-containing DNAs, especially mCAC-containing DNAs, are recognized by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) to regulate gene expression in neuron development. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the binding of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2 to these different DNA motifs is unclear. Here, we systematically characterized the DNA-binding selectivities of the MBD domains in MeCP2 and MBD1-4 with isothermal titration calorimetry-based binding assays, mutagenesis studies, and X-ray crystallography. We found that the MBD domains of MeCP2 and MBD1-4 bind mCG-containing DNAs independently of the sequence identity outside the mCG dinucleotide. Moreover, some MBD domains bound to both methylated and unmethylated CA dinucleotide-containing DNAs, with a preference for the CAC sequence motif. We also found that the MBD domains bind to mCA or nonmethylated CA DNA by recognizing the complementary TG dinucleotide, which is consistent with an overlooked ligand of MeCP2,},

Its deregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of diverse cancer and immune diseases. Recent experimental evidence reveals that dynamic histone methylation/demethylation mediated by histone methyltransferases and demethylases plays a critical role in regulation of chromatin remodelling and gene expression. In the present study, we compared the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) methylation status of the 15-LOX-1 promoter region of the two Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell lines L1236 and L428 with abundant and undetectable 15-LOX-1 expression, respectively. We identified a potential role of H3-K4 methylation in positive regulation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. Furthermore, we found that histone methyltransferase SMYD3 inhibition reduced 15-LOX-1 expression by decreasing promoter activity in L1236 cells. SMYD3 knock down in these cells abolished di-/trimethylation of H3-K4, attenuated the occupancy by the transactivator STAT6, and led to diminished histone H3 acetylation at the 15-LOX-1 promoter. In contrast, inhibition of SMCX, a JmjC-domain-containing H3-K4 tri-demethylase, upregulated 15-LOX-1 expression through induction of H3-K4 trimethylation, histone acetylation and STAT6 recruitment at the 15-LOX-1 promoter in L428 cells. In addition, we observed strong SMYD3 expression in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and its inhibition led to decreased 15-LOX-1 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that regulation of histone methylation/demethylation at the 15-LOX-1 promoter is important in 15-LOX-1 expression.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The subcellular localization of specific RNA molecules promotes localized cellular activity across a variety of species and cell types. The misregulation of this RNA targeting can result in developmental defects, and mutations in proteins that regulate this process are associated with multiple diseases. For the vast majority of localized RNAs, however, the mechanisms that underlie their subcellular targeting are unknown, partly due to the difficulty associated with profiling and quantifying subcellular RNA populations. To address this challenge, we developed Halo‐seq, a proximity labeling technique that can label and profile local RNA content at virtually any subcellular location. Halo‐seq relies on a HaloTag fusion protein localized to a subcellular space of interest. Through the use of a radical‐producing Halo ligand, RNAs that are near the HaloTag fusion are specifically labeled with spatial and temporal control. Labeled RNA is then specifically biotinylated               in vitro               via a click reaction, facilitating its purification from a bulk RNA sample using streptavidin beads. The content of the biotinylated RNA is then profiled using high‐throughput sequencing. In this article, we describe the experimental and computational procedures for Halo‐seq, including important benchmark and quality control steps. By allowing the flexible profiling of a variety of subcellular RNA populations, we envision Halo‐seq facilitating the discovery and further study of RNA localization regulatory mechanisms. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

  abstract = {The brain is programmed to drive behaviour by precisely wiring the appropriate neuronal circuits. Wiring and rewiring of neuronal circuits largely depends on the orchestrated changes in the strengths of synaptic contacts. Here, we review how the rules of synaptic plasticity change during development of the brain, from birth to independence. We focus on the changes that occur at the postsynaptic side of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the rodent hippocampus and neocortex. First we summarize the current data on the structure of synapses and the developmental expression patterns of the key molecular players of synaptic plasticity, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, as well as pivotal kinases (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, protein kinase C) and phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B). In the second part we relate these findings to important characteristics of the emerging network. We argue that the concerted and gradual shifts in the usage of plasticity molecules comply with the changing need for (re)wiring neuronal circuits.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic modification that covers vertebrate genomes. Regions known as CpG islands (CGIs), which are refractory to DNA methylation, are often associated with gene promoters and play central roles in gene regulation. Yet how CGIs in their normal genomic context evade the DNA methylation machinery and whether these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved remains enigmatic. To address these fundamental questions we exploited a transchromosomic animal model and genomic approaches to understand how the hypomethylated state is formed in vivo and to discover whether mechanisms governing CGI formation are evolutionarily conserved. Strikingly, insertion of a human chromosome into mouse revealed that promoter-associated CGIs are refractory to DNA methylation regardless of host species, demonstrating that DNA sequence plays a central role in specifying the hypomethylated state through evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. In contrast, elements distal to gene promoters exhibited more variable methylation between host species, uncovering a widespread dependence on nucleotide frequency and occupancy of DNA-binding transcription factors in shaping the DNA methylation landscape away from gene promoters. This was exemplified by young CpG rich lineage-restricted repeat sequences that evaded DNA methylation in the absence of co-evolved mechanisms targeting methylation to these sequences, and species specific DNA binding events that protected against DNA methylation in CpG poor regions. Finally, transplantation of mouse chromosomal fragments into the evolutionarily distant zebrafish uncovered the existence of a mechanistically conserved and DNA-encoded logic which shapes CGI formation across vertebrate species.},

  abstract = {Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles in eukaryotic cells that drive cell movement and act as cell antennae that receive and transmit signals. In addition to receiving and transducing external signals that activate signal cascades, cilia also secrete ciliary ectosomes that send signals to recipient cells, and thereby mediate cell-cell communication. Abnormal ciliary function leads to various ciliopathies, and the precise transport and localization of ciliary membrane proteins are essential for cilium function. This review summarizes current knowledge about the transport processes of ciliary membrane proteins after their synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum: modification and sorting in the Golgi apparatus, transport through vesicles to the ciliary base, entrance into cilia through the diffusion barrier, and turnover by ectosome secretion. The molecular mechanisms and regulation involved in each step are also discussed. Transport of ciliary membrane proteins is a complex, precise cellular process coordinated among multiple organelles. By systematically analyzing the existing research, we identify topics that should be further investigated to promote progress in this field of research.},

  abstract = {The distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the hippocampal formation was determined using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) specific for TRH. RIA of hippocampal subregions revealed that the CA3 region of the hippocampal formation contained the highest amount of TRH, followed by intermediate levels in region CA1 and the dentate gyrus. The hilus and subiculum contained the lowest levels. The issue of whether hippocampal TRH is derived from extrinsic and/or intrinsic sources was evaluated by making lesions of the major subcortical afferent to the hippocampus, the fornix pathway. Analysis of the hippocampal formation by RIA revealed that the ventral hippocampus contains higher levels of TRH than the dorsal hippocampus (6.01 +/- 0.62 pg/mg tissue weight vs 1.11 +/- 0.19 pg/mg tissue weight). Lesions of the fornix produced significant decreases in ventral TRH to 52.9\% of its control level and in dorsal TRH to 28.8\% of its control level. The results from these studies suggest that (1) there is a differential distribution of TRH in the hippocampal formation, (2) the hippocampal formation might be composed of extrinsic and intrinsic sources of TRH, and (3) extrinsic sources of TRH might enter the hippocampus via the fornix pathway. In addition (4) the greater post-lesion decrement in ventral vs dorsal hippocampal TRH suggests that TRH fibers traversing the fornix innervate the ventral hippocampal formation in preference to its dorsal counterpart.},

H3K4me3 demethylases of the KDM5 family have been previously implicated in development, but how the regulation of H3K4me3 level controls developmental processes is not fully established. Here, we show that the H3K4 demethylase RBR-2, the unique member of the KDM5 family in C. elegans, acts cell-autonomously and in a catalytic-dependent manner to control vulva precursor cells fate acquisition, by promoting the LIN-12/Notch pathway. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that RBR-2 reduces the H3K4me3 level at transcription start sites (TSSs) and in regions upstream of the TSSs, and acts both as a transcription repressor and activator. Analysis of the lin-11 genetic locus, a direct RBR-2 target gene required for vulva precursor cell fate acquisition, shows that RBR-2 controls the epigenetic signature of the lin-11 vulva-specific enhancer and lin-11 expression, providing in vivo evidence that RBR-2 can positively regulate transcription and cell fate acquisition by controlling enhancer activity.},

Treatments which raise the level of IL-1β in the brain impair memory consolidation in contextual fear conditioning. However, the effect of IL-1β on memory reconsolidation has not yet been established. The melanocortin α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions by antagonizing the effect of proinflammatory cytokines. Five subtypes of melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) have been identified, of which MC3R and MC4R are predominant in the central nervous system. The present experiments show that the injection of IL-1β (5 ng/0.25 μl) in dorsal hippocampus up to 30 min after re-exposition to the context decreases freezing during the contextual fear test. Impairment of memory reconsolidation was reversed by treatment with α-MSH (0.05 μg/0.25 μl). Administration of the MC4 receptor antagonist HS014 (0.5 μg/0.25 μl) blocked the effect of α-MSH. These results suggest that IL-1β may influence memory reconsolidation and that activation of central MC4R could lead to improve cognitive performance.},

Here we show rates for X-chromosome mosaicism are four times higher than mean autosomal rates; X mosaic events more often include the entire chromosome and participants with X events more likely harbour autosomal mosaic events. X mosaicism frequency increases with age (0.11\% in 50-year olds; 0.45\% in 75-year olds), as reported for Y and autosomes. Methylation array analyses of 33 women with X mosaicism indicate events preferentially involve the inactive X chromosome. Our results provide further evidence that the sex chromosomes undergo mosaic events more frequently than autosomes, which could have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of mosaic events and their possible contribution to risk for chronic diseases.},

To investigate the function of the Xist gene product, we have generated male and female mice that carry a deletion in the structural gene but maintain a functional Xist promoter. Mutant males were healthy and fertile. Females that inherited the mutation from their mothers were also normal and had the wild-type paternal X chromosome inactive in every cell. In contrast to maternal transmission, females that carry the mutation on the paternal X chromosome were severely growth-retarded and died early in embryogenesis. The wild-type maternal X chromosome was inactive in every cell of the growth-retarded embryo proper, whereas both X chromosomes were expressed in the mutant female trophoblast where X inactivation is imprinted. However, an XO mouse with a paternally inherited Xist mutation was healthy and appeared normal. The imprinted lethal phenotype of the mutant females is therefore due to the inability of extraembryonic tissue with two active X chromosomes to sustain the embryo. Our results indicate that the Xist RNA is required for female dosage compensation but plays no role in spermatogenesis.},

Although it is a high-confidence ASD risk gene, the neurodevelopmental functions of POGZ remain unclear. Here we reveal the genomic binding of POGZ in the developing forebrain at euchromatic loci and gene regulatory elements (REs). We profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in PogzÀ/À mice and show that POGZ promotes the active chromatin state and transcription of clustered synaptic genes. We further demonstrate that POGZ forms a nuclear complex and co-occupies loci with ADNP, another high-confidence ASD risk gene, and provide evidence that POGZ regulates other neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes as well. Our results reveal a neurodevelopmental function of an ASD risk gene and identify molecular targets that may elucidate its function in ASD.},

  abstract = {Dendrites and spines are the main neuronal structures receiving input from other neurons and glial cells. Dendritic and spine number, size, and morphology are some of the crucial factors determining how signals coming from individual synapses are integrated. Much remains to be understood about the characteristics of neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines in autism and related disorders. Although there have been many studies conducted using autism mouse models, few have been carried out using postmortem human tissue from patients. Available animal models of autism include those generated through genetic modifications and those non-genetic models of the disease. Here, we review how dendrite and spine morphology and number is affected in autism and related neurodevelopmental diseases, both in human, and genetic and non-genetic animal models of autism. Overall, data obtained from human and animal models point to a generalized reduction in the size and number, as well as an alteration of the morphology of dendrites; and an increase in spine densities with immature morphology, indicating a general spine immaturity state in autism. Additional human studies on dendrite and spine number and morphology in postmortem tissue are needed to understand the properties of these structures in the cerebral cortex of patients with autism. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Immunocytochemistry using these antibodies revealed that both proteins were strongly expressed in the developing cerebral cortex in the rat in distinct fashion. The midkine gene product was primarily detected in the embryonic period and was not observed in the postnatal cerebral cortex, whereas pleiotrophin was most intense in the early postnatal period, in addition to being present the embryonic period. Pleiotrophin was also localized in the adult cerebral cortex, albeit with much less intensity than in the embryonic and early postnatal period. These temporal patterns were consistent with those of the mRNA expression. The ultrastructural localization of both factors showed markedly similar profiles; immunopositive substances were primarily associated with the cell surface and were found preferentially in the regions where cell migration and neurite outgrowth take place, implying that this family functions primarily in developmental events mediated by cell-cell contact. The present results suggest that the midkine gene product and pleiotrophin are differentially involved in cortical development at different stages.},

We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent. Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53. Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1. p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure. Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1. Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats. In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 mRNA displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye. Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation. Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it as a candidate tumor suppressor. The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development.},

They can be considered as perfectly fine members of genomes replicating with resident genes and being transmitted vertically to the next generation. However, unlike regular genes, TEs have the ability to send new copies to new sites. As such, they have been considered as parasitic members ensuring their own replication. In another view, TEs may also be considered as symbiotic sequences providing shared benefits after mutualistic interactions with their host genome. In this review, we recall the relationship between TEs and their host genome and discuss why transient relaxation of TE silencing within specific developmental windows may be useful for both.},

Most of the recent data are about the role of galanin in the central regulation of food intake and energy metabolism, and to some extent, in the regulation of reproduction. It seems that galanin plays a modulatory rather than regulatory role in the central and peripheral branches of the neuroendocrine systems. In the hypothalamus, it functions as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. In the pituitary and the peripheral endocrine glands, it acts via its receptors (GALRs) in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. The development of new, selective and potent antagonists of GALRs should keep advancing our knowledge not only in the physiology but also the pathophysiology of galanin as well.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular biology and complementary information derived from neuropharmacology, biochemistry and behavior have dramatically increased our understanding of various aspects of GABAA receptors. These studies have revealed that the GABAA receptor is derived from various subunits such as alpha1-alpha6, beta1-beta3, gamma1-gamma3, delta, epsilon, pi, and rho1-3. Furthermore, two additional subunits (beta4, gamma4) of GABAA receptors in chick brain, and five isoforms of the rho-subunit in the retina of white perch (Roccus americana) have been identified. Various techniques such as mutation, gene knockout and inhibition of GABAA receptor subunits by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been used to establish the physiological/pharmacological significance of the GABAA receptor subunits and their native receptor assemblies in vivo. Radioligand binding to the immunoprecipitated receptors, co-localization studies using immunoaffinity chromatography and immunocytochemistry techniques have been utilized to establish the composition and pharmacology of native GABAA receptor assemblies. Partial agonists of GABAA receptors are being developed as anxiolytics which have fewer and less severe side effects as compared to conventional benzodiazepines because of their lower efficacy and better selectivity for the GABAA receptor subtypes. The subunit requirement of various drugs such as anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, general anesthetics, barbiturates, ethanol and neurosteroids, which are known to elicit at least some of their pharmacological effects via the GABAA receptors, have been investigated during the last few years so as to understand their exact mechanism of action. Furthermore, the molecular determinants of clinically important drug-targets have been investigated. These aspects of GABAA receptors have been discussed in detail in this review article.},

  abstract = {The identification of histone methyltransferases and demethylases has uncovered a dynamic methylation system needed to modulate appropriate levels of gene expression. Gene expression levels of various histone demethylases, such as the JARID1 family, show distinct patterns of embryonic and adult expression and respond to different environmental cues, suggesting that histone demethylase protein levels must be tightly regulated for proper development. In our study, we show that the protein level of the yeast histone H3 Lys 4 (H3 K4) demethylase Jhd2/Kdm5 is modulated through polyubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Not4 and turnover by the proteasome. We determine that polyubiquitin-mediated degradation of Jhd2 controls in vivo H3 K4 trimethylation and gene expression levels. Finally, we show that human NOT4 can polyubiquitinate human JARID1C/SMCX, a homolog of Jhd2, suggesting that this is likely a conserved mechanism. We propose that Not4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that monitors and controls a precise amount of Jhd2 protein so that the proper balance between histone demethylase and histone methyltransferase activities occur in the cell, ensuring appropriate levels of H3 K4 trimethylation and gene expression.},

Here we examine whether DAZL directly regulates progenitor spermatogonia using a conditional genetic mouse model and in vivo biochemical approaches combined with chemical synchronization of spermatogenesis. We find that the absence of               Dazl               impairs both expansion and differentiation of the spermatogonial progenitor population. In undifferentiated spermatogonia, DAZL binds the 3' UTRs of \textasciitilde 2,500 protein-coding genes. Some targets are known regulators of spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation while others are broadly expressed, dosage-sensitive factors that control transcription and RNA metabolism. DAZL binds 3' UTR sites conserved across vertebrates at a UGUU(U/A) motif. By assessing ribosome occupancy in undifferentiated spermatogonia, we find that DAZL increases translation of its targets. In total, DAZL orchestrates a broad translational program that amplifies protein levels of key spermatogonial and gene regulatory factors to promote the expansion and differentiation of progenitor spermatogonia.},

Members of this protein family contain a highly conserved 130- to 140-amino acid motif termed the SET domain. We report the purification and molecular identification of the subunits of a protein complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that includes the trithorax-related protein Set1. This protein complex, which we have named COMPASS (Complex Proteins Associated with Set1), consists of seven polypeptides ranging from 130 to 25 kDa. The same seven proteins were identified in COMPASS purified either by conventional biochemical chromatography or tandem-affinity tagging of the individual subunits of the complex. Null mutants missing any one of the six nonessential subunits of COMPASS grow more slowly than wild-type cells under normal conditions and demonstrate growth sensitivity to hydroxyurea. Furthermore, gene expression profiles of strains missing either of two nonessential subunits of COMPASS are altered in similar ways, suggesting these proteins have similar roles in gene expression in vivo. Molecular characterization of trithorax complexes will facilitate defining the role of this class of proteins in the regulation of gene expression and how their misregulation results in the development of human cancer.},

Evidence suggests that these bioactive peptides play a role in the regulation of metabolism, pancreatic β-cell function, energy homeostasis, mood and behaviour in several species, including zebrafish, rodents and humans. Galanin signalling suppresses insulin secretion in animal models (but not in humans), is potently obesogenic and plays putative roles governing certain evolutionary behaviours and mood modulation. Spexin decreases insulin secretion and has potent anorectic, analgesic, anxiolytic and antidepressive-like effects in animal models. Kisspeptin modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, food intake and/or energy expenditure in animal models and humans. Furthermore, kisspeptin is implicated in the control of reproductive behaviour in animals, modulation of human sexual and emotional brain processing, and has antidepressive and fear-suppressing effects. In addition, galanin-like peptide is a further member of the galaninergic family that plays emerging key roles in metabolism and behaviour. Therapeutic interventions targeting galanin, spexin and/or kisspeptin signalling pathways could therefore contribute to the treatment of conditions ranging from obesity to mood disorders. However, many gaps and controversies exist, which must be addressed before the therapeutic potential of these bioactive peptides can be established.},

We further show that the MLL SET domain is a histone H3 lysine 4-specific methyltransferase whose activity is stimulated with acetylated H3 peptides. This methylase activity is associated with Hox gene activation and H3 (Lys4) methylation at cis-regulatory sequences in vivo. A leukemogenic MLL fusion protein that activates Hox expression had no effect on histone methylation, suggesting a distinct mechanism for gene regulation by MLL and MLL fusion proteins.},

  abstract = {In the brain, neuronal gene expression is dynamically changed in response to neuronal activity. In particular, the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) such as egr-1, c-fos, and Arc is rapidly and selectively upregulated in subsets of neurons in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory formation. IEG expression has therefore been widely used as a molecular marker for neuronal populations that undergo plastic changes underlying formation of long-term memory. In recent years, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic studies of neurons expressing c-fos or Arc have revealed that, during learning, IEG-positive neurons encode and store information that is required for memory recall, suggesting that they may be involved in formation of the memory trace. However, despite accumulating evidence for the role of IEGs in synaptic plasticity, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with this process remain unclear. In this review, we first summarize recent literature concerning the role of IEG-expressing neuronal ensembles in organizing the memory trace. We then focus on the physiological significance of IEGs, especially Arc, in synaptic plasticity, and describe our hypotheses about the importance of Arc expression in various types of input-specific circuit reorganization. Finally, we offer perspectives on Arc function that would unveil the role of IEG-expressing neurons in the formation of memory traces in the hippocampus and other brain areas.},

However, these genes are generally hypomethylated in the blastocyst, implicating alternative repressive pathways before implantation. Indeed, in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), an overlapping set of genes, including germline “genome-defence” (GGD) genes, are upregulated following deletion of the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 or subunits of the non-canonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6. Here, we show that in pre-implantation embryos and naïve ESCs (nESCs), hypomethylated promoters of germline genes bound by the PRC1.6 DNA-binding subunits MGA/MAX/E2F6 are enriched for RING1B-dependent H2AK119ub1 and H3K9me3. Accordingly, repression~of these genes in nESCs shows a greater dependence on PRC1.6 than DNAme. In contrast, GGD genes are hypermethylated in epiblast-like cells~(EpiLCs) and their silencing is dependent upon SETDB1, PRC1.6/RING1B and DNAme, with H3K9me3 and DNAme establishment dependent upon MGA binding. Thus, GGD genes are initially repressed by PRC1.6, with DNAme subsequently engaged in post-implantation embryos.},

  abstract = {The idea that there is an impenetrable barrier that separates the germline and soma has shaped much thinking in evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines. However, recent research has revealed that the so-called ‘Weismann Barrier’ is leaky, and that information is transferred from soma to germline. Moreover, the germline itself is now known to age, and to be influenced by an age-related deterioration of the soma that houses and protects it. This could reduce the likelihood of successful reproduction by old individuals, but also lead to long-term deleterious consequences for any offspring that they do produce (including a shortened lifespan). Here, we review the evidence from a diverse and multidisciplinary literature for senescence in the germline and its consequences; we also examine the underlying mechanisms responsible, emphasizing changes in mutation rate, telomere loss, and impaired mitochondrial function in gametes. We consider the effect on life-history evolution, particularly reproductive scheduling and mate choice. Throughout, we draw attention to unresolved issues, new questions to consider, and areas where more research is needed. We also highlight the need for a more comparative approach that would reveal the diversity of processes that organisms have evolved to slow or halt age-related germline deterioration.},

AC1 occurs predominantly in hippocampus and cerebellum, AC5 is restricted to the basal ganglia, whereas AC2 is more widely expressed, but at much lower levels. The distribution and abundance of adenylyl cyclase protein were examined by immunohistochemistry with an antiserum that recognizes a peptide sequence shared by all known mammalian adenylyl cyclase isoforms. The immunoreactivity in striatum and hippocampus could be readily interpreted within the context of previous in situ hybridization studies. However, extending the information that could be gathered by comparisons with in situ hybridization analysis, it was apparent that staining was confined to the neuropil–corresponding to immunoreactive dendrites and axon terminals. Electron microscopy indicated a remarkably selective subcellular distribution of adenylyl cyclase protein. In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the densest immunoreactivity was seen in postsynaptic densities in dendritic spine heads. Labeled presynaptic axon terminals were also observed, indicating the participation of adenylyl cyclase in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. The selective concentration of adenylyl cyclases at synaptic sites provides morphological data for understanding the pre- and postsynaptic roles of adenylyl cyclase in discrete neuronal circuits in rat brain. The apparent clustering of adenylyl cyclases, coupled with other data that suggest higher-order associations of regulatory elements including G proteins, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and cAMP-dependent protein kinases, suggests not only that the primary structural information has been encoded to render the cAMP system responsive to the Ca(2+)-signaling system but also that higher-order strictures are in place to ensure that Ca2+ signals are economically delivered and propagated.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Generation of new neurons occurs normally in the adult brain in two locations: the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the walls of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been implicated in cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and recovery of stress response. Imprinted genes are highly prevalent in the brain and have adult and developmental important functions. Genetic deletion of the imprinted gene               Dlk1               from either parental allele shows that DLK1 is a key mediator of quiescence in adult hippocampal NSCs. Additionally,               Dlk1               is exquisitely dosage sensitive in the brain with perturbations in levels resulting in impaired NSCs function and cognitive phenotypes.                        ,                             Neurogenesis in the adult brain gives rise to functional neurons, which integrate into neuronal circuits and modulate neural plasticity. Sustained neurogenesis throughout life occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and is hypothesized to be involved in behavioral/cognitive processes such as memory and in diseases. Genomic imprinting is of critical importance to brain development and normal behavior, and exemplifies how epigenetic states regulate genome function and gene dosage. While most genes are expressed from both alleles, imprinted genes are usually expressed from either the maternally or the paternally inherited chromosome. Here, we show that in contrast to its canonical imprinting in nonneurogenic regions,               Delta-like homolog 1               (               Dlk1               ) is expressed biallelically in the SGZ, and both parental alleles are required for stem cell behavior and normal adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. To evaluate the effects of maternally, paternally, and biallelically inherited mutations within the               Dlk1               gene in specific behavioral domains, we subjected               Dlk1               -mutant mice to a battery of tests that dissociate and evaluate the effects of               Dlk1               dosage on spatial learning ability and on anxiety traits. Importantly, reduction in               Dlk1               levels triggers specific cognitive abnormalities that affect aspects of discriminating differences in environmental stimuli, emphasizing the importance of selective absence of imprinting in this neurogenic niche.},

  abstract = {Many hormones act on neuroendocrine cells by activating second messenger pathways. Two of these, the phosphoinositol and cAMP-dependent pathways, cause changes in cellular activity through specific protein kinases. By phosphorylating cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, these kinases apparently coordinate cellular processes, including the biosynthesis and release of neuropeptides. Somatostatin biosynthesis and release, for example, are both positively regulated by the second messenger cAMP in hypothalamic cells, and cAMP also induces somatostatin gene transcription 8-10-fold in transfected PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Transcriptional induction requires a 30-nucleotide cAMP response element (CRE) which is conserved in other cAMP-responsive genes. This element also confers cAMP responsiveness when placed upstream of the heterologous simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. The somatostatin gene does not, however, respond to cAMP in mutant PC12 cells which lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II activity. Activation of somatostatin gene transcription may consequently require the phosphorylation of a nuclear protein which binds to the CRE. Using a DNase I protection assay, we have characterized a nuclear protein in PC12 cells which binds selectively to the CRE in the somatostatin gene. We have purified this protein which is of relative molecular mass 43,000 (Mr 43K) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. This 43K CRE binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated in vitro when it is incubated with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Stimulating PC12 cells with forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, causes a 3-4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of this protein. We conclude that the cAMP-dependent pathway may regulate gene transcription in response to hormonal stimulation by phosphorylating this CREB protein.},

  abstract = {Studies of the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) have shown that its protein product (pRb) acts to restrict cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell differentiation. The frequent mutation of the Rb gene, and the functional inactivation of pRb in tumor cells, have spurred interest in the mechanism of pRb action. Recently, much attention has focused on pRb's role in the regulation of the E2F transcription factor. However, biochemical studies have suggested that E2F is only one of many pRb-targets and, to date, at least 110 cellular proteins have been reported to associate with pRb. The plethora of pRb-binding proteins raises several important questions. How many functions does pRb possess, which of these functions are important for development, and which contribute to tumor suppression? The goal of this review is to summarize the current literature of pRb-associated proteins.},

  abstract = {We compared the human and mouse X chromosomes to systematically test Ohno's law, which states that the gene content of X chromosomes is conserved across placental mammals. First, we improved the accuracy of the human X-chromosome reference sequence through single-haplotype sequencing of ampliconic regions. The new sequence closed gaps in the reference sequence, corrected previously misassembled regions and identified new palindromic amplicons. Our subsequent analysis led us to conclude that the evolution of human and mouse X chromosomes was bimodal. In accord with Ohno's law, 94-95\% of X-linked single-copy genes are shared by humans and mice; most are expressed in both sexes. Notably, most X-ampliconic genes are exceptions to Ohno's law: only 31\% of human and 22\% of mouse X-ampliconic genes had orthologs in the other species. X-ampliconic genes are expressed predominantly in testicular germ cells, and many were independently acquired since divergence from the common ancestor of humans and mice, specializing portions of their X chromosomes for sperm production.},

A rabbit was immunized against recombinant MK produced in L cells, and the resulting antibody was affinity purified using MK-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as a ligand. The MK-specific antibody was used to investigate the function and distribution of MK. MK of the same size as the recombinant MK produced in L cells (13 kDa) was strongly detected in a 13-day rat embryo. Weak expression was observed in the brains of a 19-day embryo, neonates, and adults. In the 13-day mouse embryos, high levels of MK were detected on the surfaces of brain cells, as well as in basement membranes and in the epithelial cells of the intestine, the jaw, and the rib. Nerve cells from the brains of 13-day or 19-day rat embryos extended neurites about twofold more efficiently on MK-coated dishes than on poly-L-lysine-coated dishes. Furthermore, anti-MK antibody inhibited neurite extension not only on MK-coated dishes, but also on poly-L-lysine-coated dishes. These results suggest that MK is an endogenous neurite outgrowth factor involved in the development of the central nervous system. Anti-MK antibody was also found to inhibit growth of Wilms' tumor cells, which secreted MK into culture medium. Thus, overproduction of MK is involved in enhanced growth of Wilms' tumor cells.},

Recent tracer coupling and optical recording studies have revealed the presence of gap junction-mediated communication between neurons during neocortical development. We have visualized gap junctions in the developing rat cerebral cortex with electron microscopy and studied the pattern of expression and cellular localization of connexins 26, 32, and 43 that take part in their formation. We found that these connexins (Cxs) are expressed differentially during development, and their patterns of expression are correlated with important developmental events such as cell proliferation, migration, and formation of cortical neuronal circuits. Specifically, we observed that the developmental profile of Cx 26 during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life matched closely the development of neuronal coupling, suggesting that coupled neurons use this gap junction protein during circuit formation in the cortex. The subsequent diminution of Cx 26 was mirrored by an increase in Cx 32 immunoreactivity, which became pronounced at the late stages of cortical maturation. In contrast, Cx 43 was localized in the cortex throughout the period of development. Its localization in radial glial fibers closely associated with migrating neurons suggests that this Cx may be involved in neuronal migration.},

Immunocytochemical analysis by using a panel of anti-connexin antibodies, as well as electron microscopy of thin sections and freeze-fracture replicas, has shown that gap junctions and their constituent proteins are abundant in the cerebral cortex of the adult rat. Their frequency and distribution vary in different cortical regions, which may reflect differences in the cellular and functional organization of these areas of the cortex. Gap junctions were identified between glial cells and, less frequently, between neuronal elements. Heterologous junctions were also identified between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and between neurons and glia; the latter category included abundant junctions between astrocytic processes and neurons. Double-antibody labelling experiments in tissue sections and in acutely dissociated cells showed that connexin 32 was expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas connexin 43, widely believed to be expressed only in astrocytes, was also localized in a population of cortical neurons. These results show that gap junctions can provide a major nonsynaptic means of communication between cortical cell types.},

  abstract = {Spag16 is the murine orthologue of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PF20, a protein known to be essential to the structure and function of the "9+2" axoneme. In Chlamydomonas, the PF20 gene encodes a single protein present in the central pair of the axoneme. Loss of PF20 prevents central pair assembly/integrity and results in flagellar paralysis. Here we demonstrate that the murine Spag16 gene encodes two proteins: 71 kDa SPAG16L, which is found in all murine cells with motile cilia or flagella, and 35 kDa SPAG16S, representing the C terminus of SPAG16L, which is expressed only in male germ cells, and is predominantly found in specific regions within the nucleus that also contain SC35, a known marker of nuclear speckles enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors. SPAG16S expression precedes expression of SPAG16L. Mice homozygous for a knockout of SPAG16L alone are infertile, but show no abnormalities in spermatogenesis. Mice chimeric for a mutation deleting the transcripts for both SPAG16L and SPAG16S have a profound defect in spermatogenesis. We show here that transduction of SPAG16S into cultured dispersed mouse male germ cells and BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells increases SPAG16L expression, but has no effect on the expression of several other axoneme components. We also demonstrate that the Spag16L promoter shows increased activity in the presence of SPAG16S. The distinct nuclear localization of SPAG16S and its ability to modulate Spag16L mRNA expression suggest that SPAG16S plays an important role in the gene expression machinery of male germ cells. This is a unique example of a highly conserved axonemal protein gene that encodes two protein products with different functions.},

Transposons constitute a bulk of the genome and, when activated, can cause genomic instability and variability by integrating into various gene loci, including those in the mammalian brain, where they can modulate stress response and adaptive behavior and contribute to brain pathology. We show that small RNAs with conserved piRNA-like features are present in the mouse brain. In addition, we describe another class of small noncoding RNAs with features of endogenous siRNAs, which along with putative piRNAs could play critical roles by silencing brain-expressed retrotransposons contributing to mammalian behavior.                        ,                             Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), long thought to be restricted to germline, have recently been discovered in neurons of               Aplysia               , with a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression underlying long-term memory. We here ask whether piwi/piRNAs are also expressed and have functional roles in the mammalian brain. Large-scale RNA sequencing and subsequent analysis of protein expression revealed the presence in brain of several piRNA biogenesis factors including a mouse piwi (Mili), as well as small RNAs, albeit at low levels, resembling conserved piRNAs in mouse testes [primarily LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear element1) retrotransposon-derived]. Despite the seeming low expression of these putative piRNAs, single-base pair CpG methylation analyses across the genome of Mili/piRNA-deficient (               Mili                                −/−                              ) mice demonstrate that brain genomic DNA is preferentially hypomethylated within intergenic areas and LINE1 promoter areas of the genome. Furthermore,               Mili               mutant mice exhibit behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity and reduced anxiety. These results suggest that putative piRNAs exist in mammalian brain, and similar to the role of piRNAs in testes, they may be involved in the silencing of retrotransposons, which in brain have critical roles in contributing to genomic heterogeneity underlying adaptation, stress response, and brain pathology. We also describe the presence of another class of small RNAs in the brain, with features of endogenous siRNAs, which may have taken over the role of invertebrate piRNAs in their capacity to target both transposons, as well as protein-coding genes. Thus, RNA interference through gene and retrotransposon silencing previously encountered in               Aplysia               may also have potential roles in the mammalian brain.},

SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a focus, with regular annotation updates to the browser and continued curation of our phylogenetic sequence placing tool, hgPhyloPlace, whose tree has now reached over 12M sequences. Our GenArk resource has also grown, offering over 2500 hubs and a system for users to request any absent assemblies. We have expanded our bigBarChart display type and created new ways to visualize data via bigRmsk and dynseq display. Displaying custom annotations is now easier due to our chromAlias system which eliminates the requirement for renaming sequence names to the UCSC standard. Users involved in data generation may also be interested in our new tools and trackDb settings which facilitate the creation and display of their custom annotations.},

We report that the combination of alpha1beta3epsilon subunit subtypes expressed in L929 cells produced functional chloride ion channels that were both spontaneously active and gated by the application of extracellular GABA. When cells were voltage-clamped at -75 mV in the whole-cell configuration, holding currents of 50 to 300 pA associated with increased noise were consistently recorded. The application of pentobarbital and loreclezole, which increase GABAR currents, increased the holding current, whereas the application of zinc and picrotoxin, which reduce GABAR currents, reduced the holding current in a concentration-dependent manner. Coexpression of alpha1beta3gamma2L, alpha1beta3delta, alpha1epsilon, beta3epsilon, alpha1beta3, or epsilon subtypes did not produce holding currents that were sensitive to picrotoxin (30 microM). Cells expressing alpha1 beta3epsilon subtypes had concentration-dependent GABAR currents that were potentiated by pentobarbital, loreclezole, and lanthanum and inhibited by zinc and furosemide. Spontaneous and GABAR single-channel currents from alpha1beta3epsilon receptors had single-channel conductances of approximately 24 pS. The biophysical properties and the effects of allosteric modulators were similar for spontaneous and evoked GABAR currents, suggesting that a single GABAR isoform was responsible for both currents. These data extend the pharmacological characterization of epsilon-containing GABARs and demonstrate that incorporation of the epsilon subunit permits spontaneous channel gating while preserving the structural information necessary for GABA sensitivity.},

Our model shows that aging is a fundamental feature of multicellular life. Current understanding of the evolution of aging holds that aging is due to the weakness of selection to remove alleles that increase mortality only late in life. Our model, while fully compatible with current theory, makes a stronger statement: Multicellular organisms would age even if selection were perfect. These results inform how we think about the evolution of aging and the role of intercellular competition in senescence and cancer.           ,              Current theories attribute aging to a failure of selection, due to either pleiotropic constraints or declining strength of selection after the onset of reproduction. These theories implicitly leave open the possibility that if senescence-causing alleles could be identified, or if antagonistic pleiotropy could be broken, the effects of aging might be ameliorated or delayed indefinitely. These theories are built on models of selection between multicellular organisms, but a full understanding of aging also requires examining the role of somatic selection within an organism. Selection between somatic cells (i.e., intercellular competition) can delay aging by purging nonfunctioning cells. However, the fitness of a multicellular organism depends not just on how functional its individual cells are but also on how well cells work together. While intercellular competition weeds out nonfunctional cells, it may also select for cells that do not cooperate. Thus, intercellular competition creates an inescapable double bind that makes aging inevitable in multicellular organisms.},

This long time course has made LTP an attractive model for certain forms of long-term memory in the mammalian brain. A hallmark of long-term memory in the intact animal is a requirement for transcription, and thus whether the late phase of LTP (L-LTP) requires transcription was investigated here. With the use of different inhibitors, it was found in rat hippocampal slices that the induction of L-LTP [produced either by tetanic stimulation or by application of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analog Sp-cAMPS (Sp-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate)] was selectively prevented when transcription was blocked immediately after tetanization or during application of cAMP. As with behavioral memory, this requirement for transcription had a critical time window. Thus, the late phase of LTP in the CA1 region requires transcription during a critical period, perhaps because cAMP-inducible genes must be expressed during this period.},

In this article, we first analyse the transformations of the concept of epigenetics, from Waddington to contemporary accounts, in order to identify its different meanings and traditions, and to come up with a typology of epigenetics throughout its history. Second, we show on this basis that epigenetics has progressively turned its main focus from biological problems regarding development, toward issues concerning evolution. Yet, both these different epistemological aspects of epigenetics still coexist. Third, we claim that the classical opposition between epigenesis and preformationism as ways of thinking about the developmental process is part of the history of epigenetics and has contributed to its current various meanings. With these objectives in mind, we first show how Waddington introduced the term "epigenetics" in a biological context in order to solve a developmental problem, and we then build on this by presenting Nanney's, Riggs' and Holliday's definitions, which form the basis for the current conception of "molecular epigenetics". Then, we show that the evo-devo research field is where some particular uses of epigenetics have started shifting from developmental issues to evolutionary problems. We also show that epigenetics has progressively focused on the issue of epigenetic inheritance within the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis' framework. Finally, we conclude by presenting a typology of the different conceptions of epigenetics throughout time, and analyse the connections between them. We argue that, since Waddington, epigenetics, as an integrative research area, has been used to bridge the gap between different biological fields.},

  abstract = {Genomic instability is a hallmark of human cancer and an enabling factor for the genetic alterations that drive cancer development. The processes involved in genomic instability resemble those of meiosis, where genetic material is interchanged between homologous chromosomes. In most types of human cancer, epigenetic changes, including hypomethylation of gene promoters, lead to the ectopic expression of a large number of proteins normally restricted to the germ cells of the testis. Due to the similarities between meiosis and genomic instability, it has been proposed that activation of meiotic programs may drive genomic instability in cancer cells. Some germ cell proteins with ectopic expression in cancer cells indeed seem to promote genomic instability, while others reduce polyploidy and maintain mitotic fidelity. Furthermore, oncogenic germ cell proteins may indirectly contribute to genomic instability through induction of replication stress, similar to classic oncogenes. Thus, current evidence suggests that testis germ cell proteins are implicated in cancer development by regulating genomic instability during tumorigenesis, and these proteins therefore represent promising targets for novel therapeutic strategies.},

Heroin-treated mice displayed robust CPA after acute spontaneous withdrawal (12h), which persisted across the extended (14days) withdrawal period. After 12-h withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed lower signal intensity of POMC-EGFP-positive cells in the ARC, higher levels of POMC mRNA in the amygdala but lower levels in the hippocampus than saline controls. After 7-d withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed fewer POMC-EGFP-positive cells in the MeA and lower POMC mRNA in the amygdala than saline controls. After extended (14days) withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed more POMC-EGFP-positive cells in BMA and DG, increased intensity of POMC-EGFP signal in DG, and higher POMC mRNA levels in the hippocampus compared to controls. Our results show dynamic changes in POMC in hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic regions that may contribute to the negative affective/emotional state of heroin withdrawal shown by CPA from acute to extended periods of heroin withdrawal.},

In the era of immune-based cancer therapeutics, redirecting our immune cells to target these tumour-specific antigens has become even more relevant. Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are a class of antigens with an expression specific to the testis and cancer cells. CTAs have also been demonstrated to be expressed in a wide variety of cancers. Due to their frequency and specificity of expression in a multitude of cancers, CTAs have been particularly attractive as cancer-specific therapeutic targets. There is now a rapid expansion of CTAs being identified and many studies have been conducted to correlate CTA expression with cancer and therapy-resistant phenotypes. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of clinical trials involving using some of these CTAs as molecular targets in pharmacological and immune-targeted therapeutics for various cancers. This review will summarise the current knowledge of the biology of known CTAs in tumorigenesis and the regulation of CTA genes. CTAs as molecular targets and the therapeutic implications of these CTA-targeted anticancer strategies will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are tiny postsynaptic protrusions from a dendrite that receive most of the excitatory synaptic input in the brain. Functional and structural changes in dendritic spines are critical for synaptic plasticity, a cellular model of learning and memory. Conversely, altered spine morphology and plasticity are common hallmarks of human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism. The advances in molecular and optical techniques have allowed for exploration of dynamic changes in structure and signal transduction at single-spine resolution, providing significant insights into the molecular regulation underlying spine structural plasticity. Here, I review recent findings on: how synaptic stimulation leads to diverse forms of spine structural plasticity; how the associated biochemical signals are initiated and transmitted into neuronal compartments; and how disruption of single genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders can lead to abnormal spine structure in human and mouse brains. In particular, I discuss the functions of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases in spatiotemporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and protein synthesis in dendritic spines. Multiple lines of evidence implicate disrupted Ras signaling pathways in the spine structural abnormalities observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Both deficient and excessive Ras activities lead to disrupted spine structure and deficits in learning and memory. Dysregulation of spine Ras signaling, therefore, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct etiologies.},

  abstract = {In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), inactivation of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) occurs in the majority of the tumors and is causal for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. Recently, a large-scale genomic sequencing study of ccRCC tumors revealed that enzymes that regulate histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3), such as JARID1C/KDM5C/SMCX and MLL2, were mutated in ccRCC tumors, suggesting that H3K4Me3 might have an important role in regulating gene expression and tumorigenesis. In this study we report that in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, the overall H3K4Me3 levels were significantly lower than that of VHL+/+ counterparts. Furthermore, this was hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) dependent, as depletion of HIF subunits by small hairpin RNA in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells restored H3K4Me3 levels. In addition, we demonstrated that only loss of JARID1C, not JARID1A or JARID1B, abolished the difference of H3K4Me3 levels between VHL-/- and VHL+/+ cells, and JARID1C displayed HIF-dependent expression pattern. JARID1C in VHL-/- cells was responsible for the suppression of HIF-responsive genes insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), DNAJC12, COL6A1, growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and density-enhanced phosphatase 1. Consistent with these findings, the H3K4Me3 levels at the promoters of IGFBP3, DNAJC12, COL6A1 and GDF15 were lower in VHL-/- cells than in VHL+/+ cells, and the differences disappeared after JARID1C depletion. Although HIF2α is an oncogene in ccRCC, some of its targets might have tumor suppressive activity. Consistent with this, knockdown of JARID1C in 786-O VHL-/- ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that JARID1C is tumor suppressive and its mutations are tumor promoting in ccRCC. Thus, VHL inactivation decreases H3K4Me3 levels through JARID1C, which alters gene expression and suppresses tumor growth.},

However, the mechanism that underlies the initial breaking of symmetry has remained unclear. In the mouse, a leftward fluid flow on the ventral side of the node caused by the vortical motion of cilia (referred to as nodal flow) is implicated in symmetry breaking, but direct evidence for the role of this flow has been lacking. Here we describe the development of a system in which mouse embryos are cultured under an artificial fluid flow and with which we have examined how flow affects L-R patterning. An artificial rightward flow that was sufficiently rapid to reverse the intrinsic leftward nodal flow resulted in reversal of situs in wild-type embryos. The artificial flow was also able to direct the situs of mutant mouse embryos with immotile cilia. These results provide the first direct evidence for the role of mechanical fluid flow in L-R patterning.},

Igf2 is a growth factor expressed in most normal tissues, solely from the paternal allele.               H19               gene is transcribed (but not translated to a protein) from the maternal allele. Igf2 protein is a growth factor particularly important during pregnancy, where it promotes both foetal and placental growth and also nutrient transfer from mother to offspring               via               the placenta.

It is emphasized that key genomic features are conserved among mammals and have been functionally tested in mouse. ‘The enhancer competition model’, ‘the boundary model’ and ‘the chromatin‐loop model’ are three models based on differential methylation as the epigenetic mark responsible for the imprinted expression pattern. Pathways are discussed that can account for allelic methylation differences; there is a recent study that contradicts the previously accepted fact that biallelic expression is accompanied with loss of differential methylation pattern.},

We report the results of a genome-wide association study of SLI which included parent-of-origin effects and child genotype effects and used 278 families of language-impaired children. The child genotype effects analysis did not identify significant associations. We found genome-wide significant paternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 14q12 (P = 3.74 × 10(-8)) and suggestive maternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 5p13 (P = 1.16 × 10(-7)). A subsequent targeted association of six single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5 in 313 language-impaired individuals and their mothers from the ALSPAC cohort replicated the maternal effects, albeit in the opposite direction (P = 0.001); as fathers' genotypes were not available in the ALSPAC study, the replication analysis did not include paternal parent-of-origin effects. The paternally-associated SNP on chromosome 14 yields a non-synonymous coding change within the NOP9 gene. This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to be significantly dysregulated in individuals with schizophrenia. The region of maternal association on chromosome 5 falls between the PTGER4 and DAB2 genes, in a region previously implicated in autism and ADHD. The top SNP in this association locus is a potential expression QTL of ARHGEF19 (also called WGEF) on chromosome 1. Members of this protein family have been implicated in intellectual disability. In summary, this study implicates parent-of-origin effects in language impairment, and adds an interesting new dimension to the emerging picture of shared genetic etiology across various neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            To coordinate cellular physiology, eukaryotic cells rely on the rapid exchange of molecules at specialized organelle–organelle contact sites               1,2               . Endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs) are particularly vital communication hubs, playing key roles in the exchange of signalling molecules, lipids and metabolites               3,4               . ERMCSs are maintained by interactions between complementary tethering molecules on the surface of each organelle               5,6               . However, due to the extreme sensitivity of these membrane interfaces to experimental perturbation               7,8               , a clear understanding of their nanoscale organization and regulation is still lacking. Here we combine three-dimensional electron microscopy with high-speed molecular tracking of a model organelle tether, Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein B (VAPB), to map the structure and diffusion landscape of ERMCSs. We uncovered dynamic subdomains within VAPB contact sites that correlate with ER membrane curvature and undergo rapid remodelling. We show that VAPB molecules enter and leave ERMCSs within seconds, despite the contact site itself remaining stable over much longer time scales. This metastability allows ERMCSs to remodel with changes in the physiological environment to accommodate metabolic needs of the cell. An amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated mutation in VAPB perturbs these subdomains, likely impairing their remodelling capacity and resulting in impaired interorganelle communication. These results establish high-speed single-molecule imaging as a new tool for mapping the structure of contact site interfaces and reveal that the diffusion landscape of VAPB at contact sites is a crucial component of ERMCS homeostasis.},

  abstract = {With the rising prevalence of cognitive impairment worldwide, clinicians are facing important challenges managing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent dementia subtype. Given that current treatments mainly offer symptomatic improvement, without altering disease progression, the challenge now is to identify and integrate new therapeutic strategies. Hypertension is increasingly recognized as a modifiable risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the precursor of dementia. The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to blood pressure regulation and medications targeting RAAS inhibition are associated with reduced rates of both cognitive and functional decline in those with MCI and dementia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are widely prescribed anti-hypertensives acting on the RAAS, and there is growing evidence that they act centrally, possibly exerting their effects independent of their blood pressure lowering properties. The relationship is complex however, and given the risks associated with hypotension particularly in older adults, treatment with these agents may not benefit all. Additionally, current evidence is limited to preclinical and observational studies such that there is now a pressing need to confirm preliminary studies with properly conducted randomized control trials. Here, we review some of the salient and complex aspects of these observations to date.},

  abstract = {E2F-6 contributes to gene silencing in a manner independent of retinoblastoma protein family members. To better elucidate the molecular mechanism of repression by E2F-6, we have purified the factor from cultured cells. E2F-6 is found in a multimeric protein complex that contains Mga and Max, and thus the complex can bind not only to the E2F-binding site but also to Myc- and Brachyury-binding sites. Moreover, the complex contains chromatin modifiers such as a novel histone methyltransferase that modifies lysine 9 of histone H3, HP1gamma, and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. The E2F-6 complex preferentially occupies target promoters in G0 cells rather than in G1 cells. These data suggest that these chromatin modifiers contribute to silencing of E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in quiescent cells.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in the human transcriptome are widespread and tissue specific, and they contribute to complex traits.           ,              The role of sex in the human transcriptome                            In humans, the inheritance of the XX or XY set of sex chromosomes is responsible for most individuals developing into adults expressing male or female sex-specific traits. However, the degree to which sex-biased gene expression occurs in tissues, especially those that do not contribute to characteristic sexually dimorphic traits. is unknown. Oliva               et al.               examined Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data and found that 37\% of genes in at least one of the 44 tissues studied exhibit a tissue-specific, sex-biased gene expression. They also identified a sex-specific variation in cellular composition across tissues. Overall, the effects of sex on gene expression were small, but they were genome-wide and mostly mediated through transcription factor binding. With sex-biased gene expression associated with loci identified in genome-wide association studies, this study lays the groundwork for identifying the molecular basis of male- and female-based diseases.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaba3066                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               Many complex human phenotypes, including diseases, exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. These sex differences have been variously attributed to hormones, sex chromosomes, genotype × sex effects, differences in behavior, and differences in environmental exposures; however, their mechanisms and underlying biology remain largely unknown. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides an opportunity to investigate the prevalence and genetic mechanisms of sex differences in the human transcriptome by surveying many tissues that have not previously been characterized in this manner.                                         RATIONALE               To characterize sex differences in the human transcriptome and its regulation, and to discover how sex and genetics interact to influence complex traits and disease, we generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and its genetic regulation across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the GTEx project (v8 data release), analyzing 16,245 RNA-sequencing samples and genotypes of 838 adult individuals. We report sex differences in gene expression levels, tissue cell type composition, and cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). To assess their impact, we integrated these results with gene function, transcription factor binding annotation, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 87 GWASs.                                         RESULTS                                Sex effects on gene expression are ubiquitous (13,294 sex-biased genes across all tissues). However, these effects are small and largely tissue-specific. Genes with sex-differentiated expression are not primarily driven by tissue-specific gene expression and are involved in a diverse set of biological functions, such as drug and hormone response, embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis, fertilization, sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis, fat metabolism, cancer, and immune response. Whereas X-linked genes with higher expression in females suggest candidates for escape from X-chromosome inactivation, sex-biased expression of autosomal genes suggests hormone-related transcription factor regulation and a role for additional transcription factors, as well as sex-differentiated distribution of epigenetic marks, particularly histone H3 Lys                 27                 trimethylation (H3K27me3).                              Sex differences in the genetic regulation of gene expression are much less common (369 sex-biased eQTLs across all tissues) and are highly tissue-specific. We identified 58 gene-trait associations driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These include loci where sex-differentiated cell type abundances mediate genotype-phenotype associations, as well as loci where sex may play a more direct role in the underlying molecular mechanism of the association. For example, we identified a female-specific eQTL in liver for the hexokinase HKDC1 that influences glucose metabolism in pregnant females, which is subsequently reflected in the birth weight of the offspring.                                         CONCLUSION               By integrating sex-aware analyses of GTEx data with gene function and transcription factor binding annotations, we describe tissue-specific and tissue-shared drivers and mechanisms contributing to sex differences in the human transcriptome and eQTLs. We discovered multiple sex-differentiated genetic effects on gene expression that colocalize with complex trait genetic associations, thereby facilitating the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS signals. Because the causative tissue is unknown for many phenotypes, analysis of the diverse GTEx tissue collection can serve as a powerful resource for investigations into the basis of sex-biased traits. This work provides an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.                                                   Sex affects gene expression and its genetic regulation across tissues.                   Sex effects on gene expression were measured in 44 GTEx human tissue sources and integrated with genotypes of 838 subjects. Sex-biased expression is present in numerous biological pathways and is associated to sex-differentiated transcriptional regulation. Sex-biased expression quantitative trait loci in cis (sex-biased eQTLs) are partially mediated by cellular abundances and reveal gene-trait associations. TT, AT, and AA are genotypes for a single-nucleotide polymorphism; TF, transcription factor.                                                                         ,              Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37\% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.},

  abstract = {Natural variation can provide important insights into the genetic and environmental factors that shape social behaviour and its evolution. The sweat bee, Lasioglossum baleicum, is a socially flexible bee capable of producing both solitary and eusocial nests. We demonstrate that within a single nesting aggregation, soil temperatures are a strong predictor of the social structure of nests. Sites with warmer temperatures in the spring have a higher frequency of social nests than cooler sites, perhaps because warmer temperatures provide a longer reproductive window for those nests. To identify the molecular correlates of this behavioural variation, we generated a de novo genome assembly for L. baleicum, and we used transcriptomic profiling to compare adults and developing offspring from eusocial and solitary nests. We find that adult, reproductive females have similar expression profiles regardless of social structure in the nest, but that there are strong differences between reproductive females and workers from social nests. We also find substantial differences in the transcriptomic profiles of stage-matched pupae from warmer, social-biased sites compared to cooler, solitary-biased sites. These transcriptional differences are strongly predictive of adult reproductive state, suggesting that the developmental environment may set the stage for adult behaviours in L. baleicum. Together, our results help to characterize the molecular mechanisms shaping variation in social behaviour and highlight a potential role of environmental tuning during development as a factor shaping adult behaviour and physiology in this socially flexible bee.},

ChIP-Rx enables the discovery and quantification of dynamic epigenomic profiles across mammalian cells that would otherwise remain hidden using traditional normalization methods. We demonstrate the utility of this method for measuring epigenomic changes following chemical perturbations and show how reference normalization of ChIP-seq experiments enables the discovery of disease-relevant changes in histone modification occupancy.},

While many cell types have a primary cilium, little is known about primary cilia in the brain, where they are less accessible than cilia on cultured cells or epithelial tissues and protrude from cell bodies into a deep, dense network of glial and neuronal processes. Here, we investigated cilia frequency, internal structure, shape, and position in large, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy volumes of mouse primary visual cortex. Cilia extended from the cell bodies of nearly all excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but were absent from oligodendrocytes and microglia. Structural comparisons revealed that the membrane structure at the base of the cilium and the microtubule organization differed between neurons and glia. OPC cilia were distinct in that they were the shortest and contained pervasive internal vesicles only occasionally observed in neuron and astrocyte cilia. Investigating cilia-proximal features revealed that many cilia were directly adjacent to synapses, suggesting cilia are well poised to encounter locally released signaling molecules. Cilia proximity to synapses was random, not enriched, in the synapse-rich neuropil. The internal anatomy, including microtubule changes and centriole location, defined key structural features including cilium placement and shape. Together, the anatomical insights both within and around neuron and glia cilia provide new insights into cilia formation and function across cell types in the brain.},

Regulatory regions in genomes such as enhancers and promoters differ in their extent of methylation of histone H3 at lysine-4 (H3K4), but it is largely unknown how the different methylation states are specified and controlled. Here, we show that the Kdm5c/Jarid1c/SMCX member of the Kdm5 family of H3K4 demethylases can be recruited to both enhancer and promoter elements in mouse embryonic stem cells and in neuronal progenitor cells. Knockdown of Kdm5c deregulates transcription via local increases in H3K4me3. Our data indicate that by restricting H3K4me3 modification at core promoters, Kdm5c dampens transcription, but at enhancers Kdm5c stimulates their activity. Remarkably, an impaired enhancer function activates the intrinsic promoter activity of Kdm5c-bound distal elements. Our results demonstrate that the Kdm5c demethylase plays a crucial and dynamic role in the functional discrimination between enhancers and core promoters.},

Although oxygen-containing amino acids important for the positioning of Ca2+ are conserved in all six domains, the conserved glycine residues in the central portion of the EF-hand motif are absent in three of them. Calcium blots showed that recombinant reticulocalbin expressed in bacterial cells binds Ca2+. The protein has the sequence His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) at its carboxyl terminus. This is similar to the Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence, which serves as a signal to retain the resident proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of animal cells. A mutant protein lacking the HDEL sequence produced by in vitro mutagenesis has been shown to be secreted into medium in transient expression assays.},

  abstract = {Neuropeptides play an important role in various neural pathways, being able to control a wide spectrum of physiological responses. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) functions are quite well studied, however little is known about their action at the level of limbic structures. The present work was focused on the expression of the aforementioned peptides in this brain structure of rats treated with olanzapine, a second generation neuroleptic drug. The detailed purpose of this experiment was the evaluation of potential relationships between chronic olanzapine administration and NPY and POMC mRNA expression in the amygdala and hippocampal formation.|The studies were carried out on adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats that were divided into 2 groups: control and experimental animals treated with olanzapine (28 day-long intraperitoneal injection). All individuals were sacrificed under anaesthesia, then the amygdaloid complexes and hippocampi were excised. Total mRNA was isolated from homogenized samples of both structures and the RT-PCR method was used for estimation of NPY and POMC gene relative expression.|Prolonged olanzapine administration is reflected in qualitatively different changes in expression of NPY and POMC mRNA in the rat amygdala and hippocampus. Interestingly enough, olanzapine did not affect NPY expression, but significantly increased the POMC level in both examined regions.|Olanzapine can affect amygdalar and hippocampal neuronal populations by the modulation of neuropeptide activity. Importantly, it may suggest the existence of an alternative mode of its action. Undoubtedly this hypothetic regulatory mechanism requires further pharmacological and neurostructural study.},

In BruChase-Seq, cells are chased in uridine for different periods of time following Bru-labeling, allowing for the isolation of RNA populations of specific ages.

Although the decreased energy expenditure and increased adiposity of melanocortin-3 receptor (Mc3R)-null mice suggest the importance of Mc3R-regulated neurons in energy homeostasis, the roles for specific subsets of Mc3R neurons in energy balance have yet to be determined. Because the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contributes to the control of energy expenditure and feeding, we generated Mc3rcre mice to determine the roles of LHA Mc3R (Mc3RLHA) neurons in energy homeostasis. We found that Mc3RLHA neurons overlap extensively with LHA neuron markers that contribute to the control of energy balance (neurotensin, galanin, and leptin receptor) and project to brain areas involved in the control of feeding, locomotion, and energy expenditure, consistent with potential roles for Mc3RLHA neurons in these processes. Indeed, selective chemogenetic activation of Mc3RLHA neurons increased locomotor activity and augmented refeeding after a fast. Although the ablation of Mc3RLHA neurons did not alter food intake, mice lacking Mc3RLHA neurons displayed decreased energy expenditure and locomotor activity, along with increased body mass and adiposity. Thus, Mc3R neurons lie within LHA neurocircuitry that modulates locomotor activity and energy expenditure and contribute to energy balance control.}

However, little is known about the modifications exactly delineating functionally engaged regulatory elements. For example, although histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) indicates the presence of transcriptional gene enhancers, it does not provide clearcut information about their actual position and stage-specific activity. Histone marks were, therefore, studied here at genomic loci differentially expressed in early stages of T-lymphocyte development. The concomitant presence of the three H3K4 methylation states (H3K4me1/2/3) was found to clearly reflect the activity of bona fide T-cell gene enhancers. Globally, gain or loss of H3K4me2/3 at distal genomic regions correlated with, respectively, the induction or the repression of associated genes during T-cell development. In the Tcrb gene enhancer, the H3K4me3-to-H3K4me1 ratio decreases with the enhancer's strength. Lastly, enhancer association of RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) correlated with the presence of H3K4me3 and Pol II accumulation resulted in local increase of H3K4me3. Our results suggest the existence of functional links between Pol II occupancy, H3K4me3 enrichment and enhancer activity.},

Currently, 13 missense mutations in KDM5C have been linked to X-linked mental retardation. However, the molecular mechanism of disease is currently unknown due to the experimental difficulties in expressing such large protein and the lack of experimental 3D structure. In this work, we utilize homology modeling, docking, and experimental data to predict 3D structures of KDM5C domains and their mutual arrangement. The resulting quaternary structure includes KDM5C JmjN, ARID, PHD1, JmjC, ZF domains, substrate histone peptide, enzymatic cofactors, and DNA. The predicted quaternary structure was investigated with molecular dynamic simulation for its stability, and further analysis was carried out to identify features measured experimentally. The predicted structure of KDM5C was used to investigate the effects of disease-causing mutations and it was shown that the mutations alter domain stability and inter-domain interactions. The structural model reported in this work could prompt experimental investigations of KDM5C domain-domain interaction and exploration of undiscovered functionalities.

Here, we identify coordinated and inversely correlated changes in dendritic morphology and mEPSC amplitude following increased neural activity. We show that overexpression of beta-catenin, a molecule that increases total dendritic length, mimics the effects of increased neuronal activity by scaling down mEPSC amplitudes, while postsynaptic expression of a protein that sequesters beta-catenin reverses the effects of activity on reducing mEPSC amplitudes. These results were confirmed immunocytochemically as changes in the size and density of surface synaptic AMPA receptor clusters. In individual neurons there was an inverse linear relationship between total dendritic length and average mEPSC amplitude. Importantly, beta-catenin overexpression in vivo promoted dendritic growth and reduced mEPSC amplitudes. Together, these results demonstrate that coordinated changes in dendritic morphology and unitary excitatory synaptic strength may serve as an important intrinsic mechanism that helps prevent neurons from overexcitation during neural circuit development.},

  abstract = {How and why female somatic X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) evolved in mammals remains poorly understood. It has been proposed that XCI is a dosage-compensation mechanism that evolved to equalize expression levels of X-linked genes in females (2X) and males (1X), with a prior twofold increase in expression of X-linked genes in both sexes (“Ohno's hypothesis”). Whereas the parity of X chromosome expression between the sexes has been clearly demonstrated, tests for the doubling of expression levels globally along the X chromosome have returned contradictory results. However, changes in gene dosage during sex-chromosome evolution are not expected to impact on all genes equally, and should have greater consequences for dosage-sensitive genes. We show that, for genes encoding components of large protein complexes (≥ 7 members)—a class of genes that is expected to be dosage-sensitive—expression of X-linked genes is similar to that of autosomal genes within the complex. These data support Ohno's hypothesis that XCI acts as a dosage-compensation mechanism, and allow us to refine Ohno's model of XCI evolution. We also explore the contribution of dosage-sensitive genes to X aneuploidy phenotypes in humans, such as Turner (X0) and Klinefelter (XXY) syndromes. X aneuploidy in humans is common and is known to have mild effects because most of the supernumerary X genes are inactivated and not affected by aneuploidy. Only genes escaping XCI experience dosage changes in X-aneuploidy patients. We combined data on dosage sensitivity and XCI to compute a list of candidate genes for X-aneuploidy syndromes.},

  abstract = {RNA–DNA hybrids are generated during transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair and are crucial intermediates in these processes. When RNA–DNA hybrids are stably formed in double-stranded DNA, they displace one of the DNA strands and give rise to a three-stranded structure called an R-loop. R-loops are widespread in the genome and are enriched at active genes. R-loops have important roles in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure, but they also pose a threat to genomic stability, especially during DNA replication. To keep the genome stable, cells have evolved a slew of mechanisms to prevent aberrant R-loop accumulation. Although R-loops can cause DNA damage, they are also induced by DNA damage and act as key intermediates in DNA repair such as in transcription-coupled repair and RNA-templated DNA break repair. When the regulation of R-loops goes awry, pathological R-loops accumulate, which contributes to diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of the sources of R-loops and RNA–DNA hybrids, mechanisms that suppress and resolve these structures, the impact of these structures on DNA repair and genome stability, and opportunities to therapeutically target pathological R-loops.},

We performed the experiments in Wistar rats, chronically instrumented for sleep recording. Bilateral PPT lesions were produced by the microinfusion of 100 nl of 0.1M ibotenic acid (IBO). Following a recovery period of 2 weeks, we recorded their sleep for 6h. Bilateral PPT lesions were identified by NADPH - diaphorase histochemistry. We applied Fourier analysis to the signals acquired throughout the 6h recordings, and each 10s epoch was differentiated as a Wake, NREM or REM state. We analyzed the topography of the sleep/wake states architecture and their transition structure, their all state-related EEG microstructures, and the sensorimotor (SMCx) and motor (MCx) cortex REM related cortico-muscular coherences (CMCs). Bilateral PPT lesion in rats increased the likelihood of the emergence of two distinct REM sleep states, specifically expressed within the MCx: REM1 and REM2. Bilateral PPT lesion did not change the sleep/wake states architecture of the SMCx, but pathologically increased the duration of REM1 within the MCx, alongside increasing Wake/REM1/Wake and NREM/REM2/NREM transitions within both cortices. In addition, the augmented total REM SMCx EEG beta amplitude and REM1 MCx EEG theta amplitude was the underlying EEG microstructure pathology. PPT lesion induced REM1 and REM2 are differential states with regard to total EMG power, topographically distinct EEG microstructures, and locomotor drives to nuchal musculature.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The human and chimpanzee genomes are strikingly similar, but our neural phenotypes are very different. Many of these differences are likely driven by changes in gene expression, and some of those changes may have been adaptive during human evolution. Yet, the relative contributions of positive selection on regulatory regions or other functional regulatory changes are unclear. Where are these changes located throughout the human genome? Are functional regulatory changes near genes or are they in distal enhancer regions? In this study, we experimentally combined both human and chimpanzee cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that showed either (1) signs of accelerated evolution in humans or (2) that have been shown to be active in the human brain. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we tested the ability of orthologous human and chimpanzee CREs to activate transcription in induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neural progenitor cells and neurons. With this assay, we identified 179 CREs with differential activity between human and chimpanzee; in contrast, we found 722 CREs with signs of positive selection in humans. Selection and differentially expressed CREs strikingly differ in level of expression, size, and genomic location. We found a subset of 69 CREs in loci with genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, which underscores the consequence of regulatory activity in these loci for proper neural development and function. By combining CREs that either experienced recent selection in humans or CREs that are functional brain enhancers, presents a novel way of studying the evolution of noncoding elements that contribute to human neural phenotypes.},

We previously demonstrated that the NDD genes encoding lysine-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C) and its transcriptional regulators Aristaless related-homeobox (ARX), PHD Finger Protein 8 (PHF8) and Zinc Finger Protein 711 (ZNF711) are functionally connected. Here, we show their relation to each other with respect to the expression levels in human and mouse datasets and in vivo mouse analysis indicating that the coexpression of these syntenic X-chromosomal genes is temporally regulated in brain areas and cellular sub-types. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the homeotic transcription factor ARX interacts with the histone demethylase PHF8, indicating that this transcriptional axis is highly intersected. Furthermore, the functional impact of pathogenic mutations of ARX, KDM5C, PHF8 and ZNF711 was tested in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from children with varying levels of syndromic ID establishing the direct correlation between defects in the KDM5C-H3K4me3 pathway and ID severity. These findings reveal novel insights into epigenetic processes underpinning NDD pathogenesis and provide new avenues for assessing developmental timing and critical windows for potential treatments.},

  abstract = {Neuronal activity is crucial for adaptive circuit remodelling but poses an inherent risk to the stability of the genome across the long lifespan of postmitotic neurons1-5. Whether neurons have acquired specialized genome protection mechanisms that enable them to withstand decades of potentially damaging stimuli during periods of heightened activity is unknown. Here we identify an activity-dependent DNA repair mechanism~in which a new form of the NuA4-TIP60 chromatin modifier assembles in activated neurons around the inducible, neuronal-specific transcription factor NPAS4. We purify this complex from the brain and demonstrate its functions in eliciting activity-dependent changes to neuronal transcriptomes and circuitry. By characterizing the landscape of activity-induced DNA double-strand breaks in the brain, we show that NPAS4-NuA4 binds to recurrently damaged regulatory elements and recruits additional DNA repair machinery to stimulate their repair. Gene regulatory elements bound by NPAS4-NuA4 are partially protected against age-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations. Impaired NPAS4-NuA4 signalling leads to a cascade of cellular defects, including dysregulated activity-dependent transcriptional responses, loss of control over neuronal inhibition and genome instability, which all culminate to reduce organismal lifespan. In addition, mutations in several components of the NuA4 complex are reported to lead to neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum~disorders. Together, these findings identify a neuronal-specific complex that couples neuronal activity directly to genome preservation, the disruption of which may contribute to developmental disorders, neurodegeneration and ageing.},

  abstract = {In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination. PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes. These double-positive nucleosomes are dramatically reduced when PRDM9 is absent, showing that this signature is PRDM9-dependent at hotspots; the residual double-positive nucleosomes most likely come from the PRDM9-independent PAR. These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process. Given the known requirement of H3K36me3 for double strand break repair by homologous recombination in somatic cells, we suggest that it may play the same role in meiosis.},

The gene order of the porcine X Chromosome (Chr) closely resembled the human X Chr (PRK/STS/KAL-AMELX-EIF2s3X/ZFX-USP9X-DBX-SMCX), suggesting that the porcine X has undergone very little rearrangement during evolution. For the porcine Y Chr, two linkage groups of 10 NRY genes were found, and the following order was established: Ypter-(AMELY-EIF2S3Y/ZFY-USP9Y-DBY/UTY)-(TSPY-SMCY-UBE1Y-SRY)-CEN. This gene order showed greater conservation with the murine Y than with the human Y Chr. In addition, all porcine Y Chr genes mapped to Yp, which is similar to the mouse and included EIF2s3Y and UBE1Y, which are not present in humans. Interestingly, complete conservation of X/Y homologous gene order was found between the pig X and Y Chrs, indicating that the porcine Y Chr has not undergone extensive reorganisation with respect to the X. This suggests that the order of the X/Y homologous genes of the porcine X and Y Chrs may closely resemble the ancestral gene order of the eutherian sex chromosomes.},

Ultrastructural alterations in the lumen and wall of smCx microvessels, including endothelial cell distortion and luminal collapse, were seen at hour 1 and continued up to 48 hours after trauma. Compared to control, there was a 40\% decrease in the average microvascular luminal area 4 hours and a trend to recover (21\%) by 48 hours after trauma. Smooth muscle (SM) in the wall of reacting microvessels showed evidence of increase contractility that coincided temporally with the decreased perfusion of cortical CBF.|Based on these observations, it is proposed that TBI causes alterations in the vascular tone of reacting microvessels which leads to prolonged vasoreactivity and restriction of the lumen in many but not all microvessels.},

To better understand how the human brain came to be, Reilly               et al.               sought to identify changes in gene expression between mice, macaques, and humans. They compared epigenetic marks in the embryonic cortex, which revealed changes in gene regulation in biological pathways associated with cortical development.

However, the genetic mechanisms contributing to these developmental changes are poorly understood. We used comparative epigenetic profiling of human, rhesus macaque, and mouse corticogenesis to identify promoters and enhancers that have gained activity in humans. These gains are significantly enriched in modules of coexpressed genes in the cortex that function in neuronal proliferation, migration, and cortical-map organization. Gain-enriched modules also showed correlated gene expression patterns and similar transcription factor binding site enrichments in promoters and enhancers, suggesting that they are connected by common regulatory mechanisms. Our results reveal coordinated patterns of potential regulatory changes associated with conserved developmental processes during corticogenesis, providing insight into human cortical evolution.},

Together, these studies are beginning to reveal the landscape of regulatory innovation in human evolution and point to specific regulatory changes for further study.

Here, we investigate the RNA binding function of ATRX, a chromatin remodeler with roles in silencing of repetitive regions of the genome and in recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We identify ATRX RNA binding regions (RBRs) and discover that the major ATRX RBR lies within the N-terminal region of the protein, distinct from its PHD and helicase domains. Deletion of this ATRX RBR (ATRXΔRBR) compromises ATRX interactions with RNAs in vitro and in vivo and alters its chromatin binding properties. Genome-wide studies reveal that loss of RNA interactions results in a redistribution of ATRX on chromatin.

Despite these early discoveries, the relevance of genomic conflict to the core principles of genetics has been largely unappreciated. In this synthetic review I will describe why knowledge of the logic and diverse forms of genomic conflict is essential to understanding all subfields of genetics. Because there are so many ways in which some parts of all prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes can evolve to gain a reproductive advantage at the expense of other parts, the prevalence of genomic conflict is universal, and it influences all aspects of genetic form and function.},

We compared the distribution of NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors in sections from rodent, primate, and human brain using the 125I-labeled ligands substance P (SP) for the NK1 receptor, neurokinin A (NKA) for the NK2 receptor, and neurokinin B (NKB) and eledoisin for NK3 receptors. Duration of exposure to autoradiographic film was from 7 days for [125I]SP up to 90 days for the other ligands. High levels of specific [125I]SP binding were seen throughout the brains of all species studied. Specific [125I]NKA binding was detected in brains from neonatal rat, and to a lesser level in adult rat, gerbil, and guinea pig; it was not detected in monkey or human brain, but was present in circular muscle of human duodenum, confirming that this ligand binds to human NK2 receptors under our experimental conditions. Specific [125I]NKB and [125I]eledoisin binding was widespread in brain sections from rats, gerbils, and guinea pigs, and very low levels were also detected in marmoset, squirrel monkey, and rhesus monkey brain after prolonged (up to 90 days) exposure. We failed to identify specific eledoisin binding in human brain, even after prolonged exposures. These findings demonstrate that the NK1 receptor is the predominant tachykinin receptor expressed in primate and human brain, but that low levels of NK3 receptor are present in nonhuman, primate brain.},

The transcriptional repressor RE1‐silencing transcription factor (REST) has been associated with aging and higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders. However, how REST contributes to the senescence program and functional impairment remains largely unknown. Here, we report that REST is essential to prevent the senescence phenotype in primary mouse neurons. REST deficiency causes failure of autophagy and loss of proteostasis, increased oxidative stress, and higher rate of cell death. Re‐establishment of autophagy reverses the main hallmarks of senescence. Our data indicate that REST has a protective role in physiological aging by regulating the autophagic flux and the senescence program in neurons, with implications for neurological disorders associated with aging.},

Important risk factors for ID are malnutrition, cultural deprivation, poor health care, and parental consanguinity. In the Western world, fetal alcohol exposure is the most common preventable cause. Most severe forms of ID have genetic causes. Cytogenetically detectable and submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements account for approximately 25\% of all cases. X-linked gene defects are responsible in 10-12\% of males with ID; to date, 91 of these defects have been identified. In contrast, autosomal gene defects have been largely disregarded, but due to coordinated efforts and the advent of next-generation DNA sequencing, this is about to change. As shown for Fra(X) syndrome, this renewed focus on autosomal gene defects will pave the way for molecular diagnosis and prevention, shed more light on the pathogenesis of ID, and reveal new opportunities for therapy.},

The phenotype of the Dazl knockout mouse has extensive germ cell loss because of incomplete meiosis. We have created a Dazl hypomorph model using short interfering RNA knockdown in mouse fetal ovary cultures, allowing investigation of Dazl function in germ cell maturation. Dazl hypomorph ovaries had a phenotype of impaired germ cell nest breakdown with a 66\% reduction in total follicle number and an increase in the proportion of primordial follicles (PMFs), with smaller oocytes within these follicles. There was no significant early germ cell loss or meiotic delay. Immunostaining of intercellular bridge component testis-expressed protein (Tex)14 showed ∼59\% reduction in foci number and size, without any change in Tex14 mRNA levels. TEX14 expression was also confirmed in the human fetal ovary across gestation. Using 3'UTR-luciferase reporter assays, translational regulation of TEX14 was demonstrated to be DAZL-dependant. Dazl is therefore essential for normal intercellular bridges within germ cell nests and their timely breakdown, with a major impact on subsequent assembly of PMFs.-Rosario, R., Crichton, J.

We have identified a receptor for MSH and ACTH peptides that is specifically expressed in regions of the hypothalamus and limbic system. This melanocortin receptor (MC3-R) is found in neurons of the arcuate nucleus known to express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and in a subset of the nuclei to which these neurons send projections. The MC3-R is 43\% identical to the MSH receptor present in melanocytes and is strongly coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Unlike the MSH or ACTH receptors, MC3-R is potently activated by gamma-MSH peptides, POMC products that were named for their amino acid homology with alpha- and beta-MSH, but lack melanotropic activity. The primary biological role of the gamma-MSH peptides is not yet understood. The location and properties of this receptor provide a pharmacological basis for the action of POMC peptides produced in the brain and possibly a specific physiological role for gamma-MSH.},

Here we map genome-wide ER-binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcomes and in distant ER-positive metastases. We find that drug-resistant cancers still recruit ER to the chromatin, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER-binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired ER regulatory regions associated with poor clinical outcome observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER-positive disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER-binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FOXA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid timescale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FOXA1 binding events in drug-resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FOXA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription-factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER-binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Apolipoprotein C1 (apoC1) is a small size apolipoprotein whose exact role is not totally clarified but which seems to modulate significantly the metabolism of lipoproteins. ApoC1 is involved in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by inhibiting the binding of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to VLDL-receptor (VLDL-R), to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and to LDL receptor related protein (LRP), by reducing the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and by stimulating VLDL production, all these effects leading to increase plasma triglycerides. ApoC1 takes also part in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) by inhibiting Cholesterol Ester Transfer Protein (CETP). The functionality of apoC1 on CETP activity is impaired in diabetes that might account, at least in part, for the increased plasma CETP activity observed in patients with diabetes. Its different effects on lipoprotein metabolism with a possible role in the modulation of inflammation makes the net impact of apoC1 on cardiometabolic risk difficult to figure out and apoC1 might be considered as pro-atherogenic or anti-atherogenic depending on the overall metabolic context. Making the link between total plasma apoC1 levels and the risk of cardio-metabolic diseases is difficult due to the high exchangeability of this small protein whose biological effects might depend essentially on its association with VLDL or HDL. The role of apoC1 in humans is not entirely elucidated and further studies are needed to determine its precise role in lipid metabolism and its possible pleiotropic effects on inflammation and vascular wall biology. In this review, we will present data on apoC1 structure and distribution among lipoproteins, on the effects of apoC1 on VLDL metabolism and HDL metabolism and we will discuss the possible links between apoC1, atherosclerosis and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Mental retardation (MR) is characterized by cognitive impairment with an IQ {$<$}70. Many of the major causes are genetically determined and the approximately 30\% male excess suggests that mutations in genes carried on the X chromosome are disproportionably represented. One such gene, jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C (JARID1C) on Xp11.2, has been identified in families with X-linked MR (XLMR), with 18 different mutations reported to date. As part of a systematic resequencing of 720 genes in 208 XLMR families of the International Genetic of Learning Disability (IGOLD) consortium, two novel nucleotide changes in the JARID1C coding region were identified, with the nucleotide changes segregating with the disease phenotype in the two families. The first mutation is a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 21 (c.3258\_3259insC p.K1087fs(*)43) causing a frameshift and resulting in a premature termination codon (PTC). Such PTC-containing mRNAs are generally degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) surveillance, but our results show that this is not the case with this mutation. The other change is a single-nucleotide substitution in exon 12 (c.1160C{$>$}A) in a published family with nonsyndromic MR, MRX13. This change occurs in a highly conserved amino acid, with proline (P) being substituted by threonine (T) (p.P554T). [corrected] Functional analysis shows that this amino-acid substitution compromises both tri- and didemethylase activity of the JARID1C protein. We conclude that the two novel changes impair JARID1C protein function and are disease-causing mutations in these families.},

  abstract = {CaMKII has molecular memory functions because transient calcium ion stimuli can induce long-lasting increases in its synaptic localization and calcium ion–independent (autonomous) activity, thereby leaving memory traces of calcium ion stimuli beyond their duration. The synaptic effects of two mechanisms that induce CaMKII autonomy are well studied: autophosphorylation at threonine-286 and binding to GluN2B. Here, we examined the neuronal functions of additional autonomy mechanisms: nitrosylation and oxidation of the CaMKII regulatory domain. We generated a knock-in mouse line with mutations that render the CaMKII regulatory domain nitrosylation/oxidation-incompetent, CaMKII               ΔSNO               , and found that it had deficits in memory and synaptic plasticity that were similar to those in aged wild-type mice. In addition, similar to aged wild-type mice, in which CaMKII was hyponitrosylated, but unlike mice with impairments of other CaMKII autonomy mechanisms, CaMKII               ΔSNO               mice showed reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) when induced by theta-burst stimulation but not high-frequency stimulation (HFS). As in aged wild-type mice, the HFS-LTP in the young adult CaMKII               ΔSNO               mice required L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The effects in aged mice were likely caused by the loss of nitrosylation because no decline in CaMKII oxidation was detected. In hippocampal neurons, nitrosylation of CaMKII induced its accumulation at synapses under basal conditions in a manner mediated by GluN2B binding, like after LTP stimuli. However, LTP-induced synaptic CaMKII accumulation did not require nitrosylation. Thus, an aging-associated decrease in CaMKII nitrosylation may cause impairments by chronic synaptic effects, such as the decrease in basal synaptic CaMKII.                        ,              Nitrosylation sends CaMKII to neuronal synapses to support learning and memory in mice.           ,              Editor’s summary                            Cognitive function declines with age, as does the amount of S-nitrosylated proteins in the brain. One such protein is the kinase CaMKII, which in neurons mediates synaptic signaling that supports learning and memory. Rumian               et~al               . found that S-nitrosylation of CaMKII was critical for the localization of the kinase to synapses and for the response of hippocampal neurons to a stimulus that mimics experience-induced brain activity. Cognitive function in young mice expressing S-nitrosylation–deficient CaMKII was impaired to similar extents as those seen in older, wild-type mice. The findings reveal a mechanism of age-related cognitive decline. —Leslie K.~Ferrarelli},

We tested the hypothesis that the impaired thymic negative selection of the recipients will permit the emergence of pathogenic T cells that cause chronic GVHD. Lethally irradiated C3H/HeN (H-2k) recipients were reconstituted with T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells from major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class II-deficient (H2-Ab1-/-) B6 (H-2b) mice. These mice developed diseases that showed all of the clinical and histopathological features of human chronic GVHD. Thymectomy prevented chronic GVHD, thus confirming the causal association of the thymus. CD4+ T cells isolated from chronic GVHD mice were primarily donor reactive, and adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells generated in these mice caused chronic GVHD in C3H/HeN mice in the presence of B6-derived antigen-presenting cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that T cells that escape from negative thymic selection could cause chronic GVHD after allogeneic BMT. These results also suggest that self-reactivity of donor T cells plays a role in this chronic GVHD, and improvement in the thymic function may have a potential to decrease chronic GVHD.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder that becomes apparent during early childhood development. The complexity of ASD makes clinically diagnosing the condition difficult. Consequently, by identifying the biomarkers associated with ASD severity and combining them with clinical diagnosis, one may better factionalize within the spectrum and devise more targeted therapeutic strategies. Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers that can be used for precise ASD diagnosis. Consequently, our pilot experimental cohort was subdivided into three groups: healthy controls, individuals those that express severe symptoms of ASD, and individuals that exhibit mild symptoms of ASD. Using next-generation sequencing, we were able to identify several circulating non-coding RNAs (cir-ncRNAs) in plasma. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show that miRNAs, piRNAs, snoRNAs, Y-RNAs, tRNAs, and lncRNAs are stably expressed in plasma. Our data identify cir-ncRNAs that are specific to ASD. Furthermore, several of the identified cir-ncRNAs were explicitly associated with either the severe or mild groups. Hence, our findings suggest that cir-ncRNAs have the potential to be utilized as objective diagnostic biomarkers and clinical targets.},

To test the hypothesis that alterations in these two genes contribute to heightened anxiety and social behavior deficits, we analyzed MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG1) that have reduced Crh and Oprm1 expression. In MECP2-TG1 animals, reducing the levels of Crh or its receptor, Crhr1, suppressed anxiety-like behavior; in contrast, reducing Oprm1 expression improved abnormal social behavior. These data indicate that increased MeCP2 levels affect molecular pathways underlying anxiety and social behavior and provide new insight into potential therapies for MECP2-related disorders.},

Here, we describe an essential function of the X-linked homolog of an ancestral X-Y gene pair, Kdm5c-Kdm5d, in the expression of Xist lncRNA, which is required for stable X-inactivation. Ablation of Kdm5c function in females results in a significant reduction in Xist RNA expression. Kdm5c encodes a demethylase that enhances Xist expression by converting histone H3K4me2/3 modifications into H3K4me1. Ectopic expression of mouse and human KDM5C, but not the Y-linked homolog KDM5D, induces Xist in male mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Similarly, marsupial (opossum) Kdm5c but not Kdm5d also upregulates Xist in male mESCs, despite marsupials lacking Xist, suggesting that the KDM5C function that activates Xist in eutherians is strongly conserved and predates the divergence of eutherian and metatherian mammals. In support, prototherian (platypus) Kdm5c also induces Xist in male mESCs. Together, our data suggest that eutherian mammals co-opted the ancestral demethylase KDM5C during sex chromosome evolution to upregulate Xist for the female-specific induction of X-inactivation.},

  abstract = {Lahn and Page previously observed that genes on the human X chromosome were physically arranged along the chromosome in "strata," roughly ordered by degree of divergence from related genes on the Y chromosome. They hypothesized that this ordering results from a historical series of suppressions of recombination along the mammalian Y chromosome, thereby allowing formerly recombining X and Y chromosomal genes to diverge independently. Here predictions of this hypothesis are confirmed in a nonprimate mammalian order, Rodentia, through an analysis of eight gene pairs from the X and Y chromosomes of the house mouse, Mus musculus. The mouse X chromosome has been rearranged relative to the human X, so strata were not found in the same physical order on the mouse X. However, based on synonymous evolutionary distances, X-linked genes in M. musculus fall into the same strata as orthologous genes in humans, as predicted. The boundary between strata 2 and 3 is statistically significant, but the boundary between strata 1 and 2 is not significant in mice. An analysis of smaller fragments of Smcy, Smcx, Zfy, and Zfx from seven species of Mus confirmed that the strata in Mus musculus were representative of the genus Mus.},

An analysis of replacement and silent substitutions, using a counting method designed for samples with small evolutionary distances, showed a significant difference between the two genes. The different patterns of replacement and silent substitutions within Jarid1d and Jarid1c may be a result of evolutionary mechanisms that are particularly strong on the Y chromosome because of its unique properties.

Intron sequences from a gene in the nonrecombining region of the Y chromosome Jarid1d (Smcy) and its X chromosomal gametolog, Jarid1c (Smcx), were analyzed in a phylogenetic context. The male-to-female mutation rate ratio for all thirteen taxa is approximately 2.5, which is similar to previous estimates in more distantly related rodents. However, when branches with lengths of more than 2.5\% were removed from the analysis, the male-to-female mutation rate ratio dropped to 0.9. Thus, in closely related rodents, as in closely related primates, the male-to-female mutation rate ratio is lower than expected.},

KDM5C encodes for a member of an ARID protein family that harbors conserved DNA-binding motifs and acts as a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase, suggesting a potential role in epigenetic regulation during development, cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we describe clinical and genetic findings of a Brazilian family co-segregating a novel nonsense mutation (c.2172C{$>$}A) in exon 15 of KDM5C gene with the intellectual disability phenotype. The transition resulted in replacement of the normal cysteine by a premature termination codon at position 724 of the protein (p.Cys724X), leading to reduced levels of KDM5C transcript probably due to nonsense mediated mRNA decay. The clinical phenotype of the proband, who has two affected brothers and a mild cognitively impaired mother, consisted of short stature, speech delay, hyperactivity, violent behavior and high palate, besides severe mental retardation. Our findings extend the number of KDM5C mutations implicated in XLID and highlight its promise for understanding neural function and unexplained cases of XLID.},

Using antibodies that discriminate between the di- and tri-methylated state of K4 we show that di-methylation occurs at both inactive and active euchromatic genes, whereas tri-methylation is present exclusively at active genes. It is therefore the presence of a tri-methylated K4 that defines an active state of gene expression.

  abstract = {Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in a large proportion of girls with Rett Syndrome. Despite extensive research, the principal role of MeCP2 protein remains elusive. Is MeCP2 a regulator of genes, acting in concert with co-activators and co-repressors, predominantly as an activator of target genes or is it a methyl CpG binding protein acting globally to change the chromatin state and to supress transcription from repeat elements? If MeCP2 has no specific targets in the genome, what causes the differential expression of specific genes in the Mecp2 knockout mouse brain? We discuss the discrepancies in current data and propose a hypothesis to reconcile some differences in the two viewpoints. Since transcripts from repeat elements contribute to piRNA biogenesis, we propose that piRNA levels may be higher in the absence of MeCP2 and that increased piRNA levels may contribute to the mis-regulation of some genes seen in the Mecp2 knockout mouse brain. We provide preliminary data showing an increase in piRNAs in the Mecp2 knockout mouse cerebellum. Our investigation suggests that global piRNA levels may be elevated in the Mecp2 knockout mouse cerebellum and strongly supports further investigation of piRNAs in Rett syndrome.},

To dissect the role of one such enzyme, the intellectual-disability-linked lysine demethylase 5C (Kdm5c), in the developing and adult brain, we conducted parallel behavioral, transcriptomic, and epigenomic studies in Kdm5c-null and forebrain-restricted inducible knockout mice. Together, genomic analyses and functional assays demonstrate that Kdm5c plays a critical role as a repressor responsible for the developmental silencing of germline genes during cellular differentiation and in fine-tuning activity-regulated enhancers during neuronal maturation. Although the importance of these functions declines after birth, Kdm5c retains an important genome surveillance role preventing the incorrect activation of non-neuronal and cryptic promoters in adult neurons.},

Here we demonstrate that the histone methyltransferase complex GLP/G9a controls cognition and adaptive responses in a region-specific fashion in the adult brain. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice, we show that postnatal, neuron-specific deficiency of GLP/G9a leads to derepression of numerous nonneuronal and neuron progenitor genes in adult neurons. This transcriptional alteration is associated with complex behavioral abnormalities, including defects in learning, motivation, and environmental adaptation. The behavioral changes triggered by GLP/G9a deficiency are similar to key symptoms of the human 9q34 mental retardation syndrome that is associated with structural alterations of the GLP/EHMT1 gene. The likely causal role of GLP/G9a in mental retardation in mice and humans suggests a key role for the GLP/G9a-controlled histone H3K9 dimethylation in regulation of brain function through maintenance of the transcriptional homeostasis in adult neurons.},

Although first recognized 40 years ago, the identity of H-Y has remained elusive. T cells detect several distinct H-Y epitopes, and these are probably peptides, derived from intracellular proteins, that are presented at the cell surface with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In the mouse, the gene(s) controlling H-Y expression (Hya) are located on the short arm of the Y chromosome between the zinc-finger genes Zfy-1 and Zfy-2. We have recently identified Smcy, a ubiquitously expressed gene, in this region and its X-chromosome homologue, Smcx. Here we report that Smcy encodes an H-YKk epitope that is defined by the octamer peptide TENSGKDI: no similar peptide is found in Smcx. These findings provide a genetic basis for the antigenic difference between males and females that contributes towards a tissue transplant rejection response.},

Global loss of methylation takes place during PGC expansion and migration with evidence for passive demethylation, but sequences that carry long-term epigenetic memory (imprints, CpG islands on the X chromosome, germline-specific genes) only become demethylated upon entry of PGCs into the gonads. The transcriptional profile of PGCs is tightly controlled despite global hypomethylation, with transient expression of the pluripotency network, suggesting that reprogramming and pluripotency are inextricably linked. Our results provide a framework for the understanding of the epigenetic ground state of pluripotency in the germline.},

Although several preclinical models using rodents of different ages have been developed, species differences in the timing of key brain maturation events can render comparisons of vulnerability and regenerative capacities difficult to interpret. Traditional models of developmental brain injury have utilized rodents at postnatal day 7-10 as being roughly equivalent to a term human infant, based historically on the measurement of post-mortem brain weights during the 1970s. Here we will examine fundamental brain development processes that occur in both rodents and humans, to delineate a comparable time course of postnatal brain development across species. We consider the timing of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, oligodendrocyte maturation and age-dependent behaviors that coincide with developmentally regulated molecular and biochemical changes. In general, while the time scale is considerably different, the sequence of key events in brain maturation is largely consistent between humans and rodents. Further, there are distinct parallels in regional vulnerability as well as functional consequences in response to brain injuries. With a focus on developmental hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and traumatic brain injury, this review offers guidelines for researchers when considering the most appropriate rodent age for the developmental stage or process of interest to approximate human brain development.},

Aggression and insensitivity to pain are largely unexplained in these cases. We analyzed nine mRNA expressions of the candidate genes related to aggression and insensitivity to pain in the peripheral blood of patients with ASD. Whole blood samples were obtained from 40 autistic patients (33 boys, 7 girls) and 50 age- and sex-matched controls (37 boys and 13 girls) to isolate RNA. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell Center (GENKOK). All of the gene expressions except CRHR1 and SLC6A4 were found to be statistically different between the ASD patients and controls. Gene expression also differed according to gender. Alterations in the mRNA expression patterns of the HTR1E, OPRL1, OPRM1, TACR1, PRKG1, SCN9A and DRD4 genes provide further evidence for a relevant effect of the respective candidate genes on the pathophysiology of ASD. Future studies may determine the sensitivity of these candidate markers in larger samples including further neuropsychiatric diagnosis.},

Often, these associations are drawn by correlating the genomic location of a particular histone modification with gene expression or phenotype; however, establishing a causal relationship between histone marks and biological processes remains challenging. Consequently, there is a strong need for experimental approaches to directly manipulate histone modifications. A class of mutations on the N-terminal tail of histone H3, lysine-to-methionine (K-to-M) mutations, was identified as dominant-negative inhibitors of histone methylation at their respective and specific residues. The dominant-negative nature of K-to-M mutants makes them a valuable tool for studying the function of specific methylation marks on histone H3. Here, we review recent applications of K-to-M mutations to understand the role of histone methylation during development and homeostasis. We highlight important advantages and limitations that require consideration when using K-to-M mutants, particularly in a developmental context.},

We have analysed the kinetics of escape at different stages of development, and in adult tissues. Our results demonstrate that Smcx exhibits partial escape from X inactivation in embryos, in extraembryonic lineages where paternally imprinted X inactivation occurs and also in adult tissues. The degree of escape in different tissues is highly variable, the level of transcript from the inactive X allele representing between 20\% and 70\% of the active X allele. Partial escape is also seen in clones derived from haematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that partial repression of the inactive X allele is at the level of individual cells. This contrasts with classical position effect variegation (PEV), where a given gene is either active or silent in a given cell and its clonal derivatives. We discuss the implications of these results with respect to mechanisms of X inactivation and escape.},

We demonstrate the ability of DART-FISH to visualize m6A in a variety of mRNAs across diverse cell types and to provide information on the location and stoichiometry of m6A sites at single-cell resolution. Finally, we use DART-FISH to reveal that m6A is not sufficient for mRNA localization to stress granules during oxidative stress. This technique provides a powerful tool for examining m6A-modified transcript dynamics and investigating methylated RNA localization in individual cells.},

Herein, using ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we report that the sex chromosome-encoded RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX3Y are distinct in their propensities for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), dissolution, and translation repression. We demonstrate that the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of DDX3Y more strongly promotes LLPS than the corresponding region of DDX3X and that the weaker ATPase activity of DDX3Y, compared with DDX3X, contributes to the slower disassembly dynamics of DDX3Y-positive condensates. Interestingly, DDX3Y-dependent LLPS represses mRNA translation and enhances aggregation of FUS more strongly than DDX3X-dependent LLPS. Our study provides a platform for future comparisons of sex chromosome-encoded protein homologs, providing insights into sex differences in RNA metabolism and human disease.},

Here, we mapped a functional POMC circuit in the mouse hippocampus, wherein POMC neurons in the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) activate MC4R in the CA1. Suppression of hippocampal MC4R activity in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD exacerbates long-term potentiation impairment, which is alleviated by the replenishment of hippocampal POMC/MC4R activity or activation of hippocampal MC4R-coupled Gs signaling. Importantly, MC4R activation rescues amyloid-β-induced synaptic dysfunction via a Gs/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent mechanism. Hence, disruption of this hippocampal POMC/MC4R circuit might contribute to synaptic dysfunction observed in AD, revealing a potential therapeutic target for the disease.},

Here, we report that a biochemical complex containing a potential chromatin reader, RACK7, and the histone lysine 4 tri-methyl (H3K4me3)-specific demethylase KDM5C occupies many active enhancers, including almost all super-enhancers. Loss of RACK7 or KDM5C results in overactivation of enhancers, characterized by the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, together with increased transcription of eRNAs and nearby genes. Furthermore, loss of RACK7 or KDM5C leads to de-repression of S100A oncogenes and various cancer-related phenotypes. Our findings reveal a RACK7/KDM5C-regulated, dynamic interchange between histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at active enhancers, representing an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity. We propose that RACK7/KDM5C functions as an enhancer "brake" to ensure appropriate enhancer activity, which, when compromised, could contribute to tumorigenesis.},

Since then, research on histone methylation has progressed rapidly. Among the identified HKMTs in mammals, G9a and GLP are the primary enzymes for mono- and dimethylation at Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2), and exist predominantly as a G9a-GLP heteromeric complex that appears to be a functional H3K9 methyltransferase in vivo.

Germline removal extends somatic lifespan through conserved pathways including insulin and mammalian target-of-rapamycin signaling, while germline hyperactivity shortens lifespan through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that mating-induced germline hyperactivity downregulates piRNAs, in turn desilencing their targets, including the Hedgehog-like ligand-encoding genes               wrt-1               and               wrt-10               , ultimately causing somatic collapse and death. Germline-produced Hedgehog signals require PTR-6 and PTR-16 receptors for mating-induced shrinking and death. Our results reveal an unconventional role of the piRNA pathway in transcriptional regulation of Hedgehog signaling and a new role of Hedgehog signaling in the regulation of longevity and somatic maintenance: Hedgehog signaling is controlled by the tunable piRNA pathway to encode the previously unknown germline-to-soma pro-aging signal. Mating-induced piRNA downregulation in the germline and subsequent Hedgehog signaling to the soma enable the animal to tune somatic resource allocation to germline needs, optimizing reproductive timing and survival.},

However, mouse XX Sertoli cells carrying Sry (XX/Sry Sertoli cells) are incapable of fully supporting germ cell development, even when the karyotype of the germ cells is XY. While it has therefore been assumed that XX/Sry Sertoli cells are not functionally equivalent to XY Sertoli cells, it has remained unclear which specific functions are affected. To elucidate the functional difference, we compared the gene expression of XY and XX/Sry Sertoli cells. Lactate and cholesterol metabolisms, essential for nursing the developing germ cells, were down-regulated in XX/Sry cells, which appears to be caused at least in part by the differential expression of histone modification enzymes SMCX/SMCY (H3K4me3 demethylase) and UTX/UTY (H3K27me3 demethylase) encoded by the sex chromosomes. We suggest that down-regulation of lactate and cholesterol metabolism that may be due to altered epigenetic modification affects the nursing functions of XX/Sry Sertoli cells.},

  abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder defined by the presence of obsessive thoughts and repetitive compulsive actions, and it often encompasses anxiety and depressive symptoms. Recently, the corticostriatal circuitry has been implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD. However, the etiology, pathophysiology and molecular basis of OCD remain unknown. Several studies indicate that the pathogenesis of OCD has a genetic component. Here we demonstrate that loss of a neuron-specific transmembrane protein, SLIT and NTRK-like protein-5 (Slitrk5), leads to OCD-like behaviors in mice, which manifests as excessive self-grooming and increased anxiety-like behaviors, and is alleviated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Slitrk5(-/-) mice show selective overactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex, abnormalities in striatal anatomy and cell morphology and alterations in glutamate receptor composition, which contribute to deficient corticostriatal neurotransmission. Thus, our studies identify Slitrk5 as an essential molecule at corticostriatal synapses and provide a new mouse model of OCD-like behaviors.},

CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression that might be targeted to promote longevity. Here, we define the role of the             Caenorhabditis elegans             CRTC-1 in the epigenetic regulation of longevity. Endogenous CRTC-1 binds chromatin factors, including components of the COMPASS complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3). CRISPR editing of endogenous CRTC-1 reveals that the CREB-binding domain in neurons is specifically required for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. However, this effect is independent of CREB but instead acts via the transcription factor AP-1. Strikingly, CRTC-1 also mediates global histone acetylation levels, and this acetylation is essential for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. Indeed, overexpression of an acetyltransferase enzyme is sufficient to promote longevity in wild-type worms. CRTCs, therefore, link energetics to longevity by critically fine-tuning histone acetylation and methylation to promote healthy ageing.},

The mechanisms by which E2 represses oncogene expression and the cellular factors through which E2 mediates this silencing are largely unknown. We conducted an unbiased, genome-wide siRNA screen and series of secondary screens that identified 96 cellular genes that contribute to the repression of the HPV LCR. In addition to confirming a role for the E2-binding bromodomain protein Brd4 in E2-mediated silencing, we identified a number of genes that have not previously been implicated in E2 repression, including the demethylase JARID1C/SMCX as well as EP400, a component of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex. Each of these genes contributes independently and additively to E2-mediated silencing, indicating that E2 functions through several distinct cellular complexes to repress E6 and E7 expression.},

  abstract = {The chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, comprising events such as laying down of meiotic cohesins, synapsis between homologs, and homologous recombination, must be preceded and enabled by the regulated induction of meiotic prophase genes. This gene regulatory program is poorly understood, particularly in organisms with a segregated germline. We characterized the gene regulatory program of meiotic prophase as it occurs in the mouse fetal ovary. By profiling gene expression in the mouse fetal ovary in mutants with whole tissue and single-cell techniques, we identified 104 genes expressed specifically in pre-meiotic to pachytene germ cells. We characterized the regulation of these genes by 1) retinoic acid (RA), which induces meiosis, 2) Dazl, which is required for germ cell competence to respond to RA, and 3) Stra8, a downstream target of RA required for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase. Initial induction of practically all identified meiotic prophase genes requires Dazl. In the presence of Dazl, RA induces at least two pathways: one Stra8-independent, and one Stra8-dependent. Genes vary in their induction by Stra8, spanning fully Stra8-independent, partially Stra8-independent, and fully Stra8-dependent. Thus, Stra8 regulates the entirety of the chromosomal program but plays a more nuanced role in governing the gene expression program. We propose that Stra8-independent gene expression enables the stockpiling of selected meiotic structural proteins prior to the commencement of the chromosomal program. Unexpectedly, we discovered that Stra8 is required for prompt down-regulation of itself and Rec8. Germ cells that have expressed and down-regulated Stra8 are refractory to further Stra8 expression. Negative feedback of Stra8, and subsequent resistance to further Stra8 expression, may ensure a single, restricted pulse of Stra8 expression. Collectively, our findings reveal a gene regulatory logic by which germ cells prepare for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, and ensure that it is induced only once.},

In transgenic mice over-expressing PNMT, observations revealed a very high level of aggression compared to their background strain, C57BL/6J. To evaluate the influence of PNMT on aggression and emotionality in this transgenic line, single-sex male and female groups were independently established that consisted of either four wild-type mice or four transgenic mice overexpressing PNMT. The members of each group were littermates. Mixed single-sex groups consisting of two transgenic mice and two wild-type mice were also established. Almost no fights were observed within the female groups. In males, the transgenic line showed a significantly higher level of fighting than controls (p=0.007) and mixed male groups (p=0.02). Housing mice from the transgenic line in mixed groups with wild-type mice seems to decrease the level of aggression in the transgenic line. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate a clear, significant increase in aggression arising from PNMT overexpression.

  abstract = {The Rett-syndrome-associated methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) selectively binds methylated DNA to regulate transcription during the development of mature neurons. Like other members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family, MeCP2 functions through the recognition of symmetrical 5-methylcytosines in CpG (mCG) dinucleotides. Advances in base-level resolution epigenetic mapping techniques have revealed, however, that MeCP2 can bind asymmetrically methylated and hydroxymethylated CpA dinucleotides and that this alternative binding selectivity modifies gene expression in the developing mammalian brain. The structural determinants of binding to methylated CpA (mCA) and hydroxymethylated DNA have not been previously investigated. Here, we employ isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy to characterize MeCP2 binding to methylated and hydroxymethylated mCG and mCA DNA, examine the effects of Rett-syndrome-associated missense mutations, and make comparisons to the related and evolutionarily most ancient protein, MBD2. These analyses reveal that MeCP2 binds mCA with high affinity in a strand-specific and orientation-dependent manner. In contrast, MBD2 does not show high affinity or methyl-specific binding to mCA. The Rett-associated missense mutations (T158M, R106W, and P101S) destabilize the MeCP2 MBD and disrupt the recognition of mCG and mCA equally. Finally, hydroxymethylation of a high-affinity mCA site does not alter the binding properties, whereas hemi-hydroxylation of the equivalent cytosine in an mCG site decreases affinity and specificity. Based on these findings, we suggest that MeCP2 recognition of methylated/hydroxymethylated CpA dinucleotides functions as an epigenetic switch redistributing MeCP2 among mCG and mCA loci.},

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased galanin-containing fibers hyperinnervate cholinergic neurons within the basal forebrain in association with a decline in cognition. We generated transgenic mice (GAL-tg) that overexpress galanin under the control of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase promoter to study the neurochemical and behavioral sequelae of a mouse model of galanin overexpression in AD. Overexpression of galanin was associated with a reduction in the number of identifiable neurons producing acetylcholine in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band. Behavioral phenotyping indicated that GAL-tgs displayed normal general health and sensory and motor abilities; however, GAL-tg mice showed selective performance deficits on the Morris spatial navigational task and the social transmission of food preference olfactory memory test. These results suggest that elevated expression of galanin contributes to the neurochemical and cognitive impairments characteristic of AD.},

Defects in primary cilia lead to a myriad of diseases in humans such as obesity and cancers. In the mature brain, both neurons and astrocytes contain a single primary cilium. Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative β-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia. In this regard, the functions, signal pathways, and structural dynamics of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia are fundamentally different. Here we discuss and compare the current understanding of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia.},

Progress in the clinical and molecular characterization of XLID has outpaced progress in the delineation of ID due to genes on the other 22 chromosomes. Almost half of the estimated 200 XLID genes have been identified and another 20\% have been regionally mapped. These advances have had immediate benefits for families, allowing for carrier testing, genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Additionally, the combination of clinical delineation with gene identification and the development of gene panels for screening nonsyndromal XLID has been able to limit unproductive laboratory testing. Most importantly for the patients, some of the gene discoveries have pointed to potential strategies for treatment. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2009;15:361–368.},

Six major groups of PRC1 complexes that differ in their subunit composition have been identified in mammals. How the different PRC1 complexes are recruited to specific genomic sites is poorly understood. The Polycomb Ring finger protein PCGF6, the transcription factors MGA and E2F6, and the histone-binding protein L3MBTL2 are specific components of the non-canonical PRC1.6 complex. In this study, we have investigated their role in genomic targeting of PRC1.6. ChIP-seq analysis revealed colocalization of MGA, L3MBTL2, E2F6 and PCGF6 genome-wide. Ablation of MGA in a human cell line by CRISPR/Cas resulted in complete loss of PRC1.6 binding. Rescue experiments revealed that MGA recruits PRC1.6 to specific loci both by DNA binding-dependent and by DNA binding-independent mechanisms. Depletion of L3MBTL2 and E2F6 but not of PCGF6 resulted in differential, locus-specific loss of PRC1.6 binding illustrating that different subunits mediate PRC1.6 loading to distinct sets of promoters. Mga, L3mbtl2 and Pcgf6 colocalize also in mouse embryonic stem cells, where PRC1.6 has been linked to repression of germ cell-related genes. Our findings unveil strikingly different genomic recruitment mechanisms of the non-canonical PRC1.6 complex, which specify its cell type- and context-specific regulatory functions.},

To contribute toward a molecular understanding of aging, we analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from multiple studies. Here, we show that transcript length alone explains most transcriptional changes observed with aging in mice and humans. We present three lines of evidence supporting the biological importance of the uncovered transcriptome imbalance. First, in vertebrates the length association primarily displays a lower relative abundance of long transcripts in aging. Second, eight antiaging interventions of the Interventions Testing Program of the National Institute on Aging can counter this length association. Third, we find that in humans and mice the genes with the longest transcripts enrich for genes reported to extend lifespan, whereas those with the shortest transcripts enrich for genes reported to shorten lifespan. Our study opens fundamental questions on aging and the organization of transcriptomes.},

Sb1.8 was sublocalized to band F of the mouse X chromosome, distal to Alas2 and proximal to DXPas1, which confirms a region of conservation between band Xp11.21-p11.22 in human and band XF in mouse. In situ hybridization also showed that the Smcx (Xe169) gene maps near Sb1.8 in band F. The Sb1.8 gene was shown to be highly conserved in mammals; partial DNA sequence analysis indicates 92\% identity between the mouse and human genes. In contrast to the human DXS423E gene, the mouse Sb1.8 gene is subject to X inactivation, as shown by restriction enzyme and sequence analysis of mRNA from mice with Searle's translocation (T(X;16)16H). Absence of Sb1.8 expression from the inactive mouse X chromosome in vitro was confirmed by analysis of a cell line (Hobmski) in which the M. spretus X chromosome is inactivated.

Using genomic analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and two-photon microscopy of astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling in vivo, we found that astrocytic expression of mGluR5 is developmentally regulated and is undetectable after postnatal week 3. In contrast, mGluR3, whose activation inhibits adenylate cyclase but not calcium signaling, was expressed in astrocytes at all developmental stages. Neuroglial signaling in the adult brain may therefore occur in a manner fundamentally distinct from that exhibited during development.},

At the onset of XCI, Jpx RNA is upregulated, binds CTCF, and extricates CTCF from one Xist allele. We demonstrate that CTCF is an RNA-binding protein and is titrated away from the Xist promoter by Jpx RNA. Thus, Jpx activates Xist by evicting CTCF.

We found that miR-320a was consistently upregulated not only in 45,X plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but also in 45,X fetal gonadal tissues. The levels of miR-320a in PBMCs from 45,X, 46,XX, 46,XY, and 47,XXY human subjects were inversely related to the expression levels of XCI-escaping gene KDM5C in PBMCs. In vitro models indicated that KDM5C suppressed miR-320a transcription by directly binding to the promoter of miR-320a to prevent histone methylation. In addition, we demonstrated that KITLG, an essential gene for ovarian development and primordial germ cell survival, was a direct target of miR-320a and that it was downregulated in 45,X fetal gonadal tissues.

It remains largely unknown how meiosis is initiated in germ cells and why non-germline cells do not undergo meiosis. We previously demonstrated that knockdown of Max expression, a gene encoding a partner of MYC family proteins, strongly activates expression of germ cell-related genes in ESCs. Here we find that complete ablation of Max expression in ESCs results in profound cytological changes reminiscent of cells undergoing meiotic cell division. Furthermore, our analyses uncovers that Max expression is transiently attenuated in germ cells undergoing meiosis in vivo and its forced reduction induces meiosis-like cytological changes in cultured germline stem cells. Mechanistically, Max depletion alterations are, in part, due to impairment of the function of an atypical PRC1 complex (PRC1.6), in which MAX is one of the components. Our data highlight MAX as a new regulator of meiotic onset.},

Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation catalyzed by the Suv39h family proteins is essential for establishing the architecture of pericentric heterochromatin. We recently identified a mammalian histone methyltransferase (HMTase), G9a, which has strong HMTase activity towards H3-K9 in vitro. To investigate the in vivo functions of G9a, we generated G9a-deficient mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that H3-K9 methylation was drastically decreased in G9a-deficient embryos, which displayed severe growth retardation and early lethality. G9a-deficient ES cells also exhibited reduced H3-K9 methylation compared to wild-type cells, indicating that G9a is a dominant H3-K9 HMTase in vivo. Importantly, the loss of G9a abolished methylated H3-K9 mostly in euchromatic regions. Finally, G9a exerted a transcriptionally suppressive function that depended on its HMTase activity. Our results indicate that euchromatic H3-K9 methylation regulated by G9a is essential for early embryogenesis and is involved in the transcriptional repression of developmental genes.},

G9a is the major mammalian H3-K9 methyltransferase that targets euchromatic regions and is essential for murine embryogenesis. There is a single G9a-related methyltransferase in mammals, called GLP/Eu-HMTase1. Here we show that GLP is also important for H3-K9 methylation of mouse euchromatin. GLP-deficiency led to embryonic lethality, a severe reduction of H3-K9 mono- and dimethylation, the induction of Mage-a gene expression, and HP1 relocalization in embryonic stem cells, all of which were phenotypes of G9a-deficiency. Furthermore, we show that G9a and GLP formed a stoichiometric heteromeric complex in a wide variety of cell types. Biochemical analyses revealed that formation of the G9a/GLP complex was dependent on their enzymatic SET domains. Taken together, our new findings revealed that G9a and GLP cooperatively exert H3-K9 methyltransferase function in vivo, likely through the formation of higher-order heteromeric complexes.},

Methylation of lysine residues in histone tails is dynamically regulated by the opposing activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases. Here we show that JARID1C/SMCX, a JmjC-domain-containing protein implicated in X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy, possesses H3K4 tri-demethylase activity and functions as a transcriptional repressor. An SMCX complex isolated from HeLa cells contains additional chromatin modifiers (the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a) and the transcriptional repressor REST, suggesting a direct role for SMCX in chromatin dynamics and REST-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that SMCX and REST co-occupy the neuron-restrictive silencing elements in the promoters of a subset of REST target genes. RNA-interference-mediated depletion of SMCX derepresses several of these targets and simultaneously increases H3K4 trimethylation at the sodium channel type 2A (SCN2A) and synapsin I (SYN1) promoters. We propose that loss of SMCX activity impairs REST-mediated neuronal gene regulation, thereby contributing to SMCX-associated X-linked mental retardation.},

Here we further confirm this overlap by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses. Both Esg1 transcript and protein exist in the egg and preimplantation embryos. At embryonic day 3.5, blastocyst stage, however, ESG1 protein was more abundant in the inner cell mass (ICM) than in trophectoderm (TE), whereas Esg1 transcript was detected in both the ICM and the TE, particularly in the polar trophectoderm. The presence of an RNA-binding KH-domain in ESG1 led us to search for and identify 902 target transcripts by microarray analysis of immunoprecipitated ESG1 complex. Interaction of 20 target mRNA with ESG1, including Cdc25a, Cdc42, Ezh2, Nfyc and Nr5a2, was further validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the immunoprecipitation material, supporting the notion that ESG1 is an RNA-binding protein which associates with specific target transcripts.},

We also defined the messenger RNA 5'-end by reverse transcription of the cap structure, thus allowing to analyze the promoter organization. Within the 5'-flanking sequence, potential regulatory regions include consensus binding sites for transcription factor Sp1, an AP-1, and several AP-2 binding sites; however, the 5' upstream region lacks both a proximal TATA and CAAT box promoter element.},

  abstract = {Once protein-coding, the X-inactivation center (Xic) is now dominated by large noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). X chromosome inactivation (XCI) equalizes gene expression between mammalian males and females by inactivating one X in female cells. XCI requires Xist, an ncRNA that coats the X and recruits Polycomb proteins. How Xist is controlled remains unclear but likely involves negative and positive regulators. For the active X, the antisense Tsix RNA is an established Xist repressor. For the inactive X, here, we identify Xic-encoded Jpx as an Xist activator. Jpx is developmentally regulated and accumulates during XCI. Deleting Jpx blocks XCI and is female lethal. Posttranscriptional Jpx knockdown recapitulates the knockout, and supplying Jpx in trans rescues lethality. Thus, Jpx is trans-acting and functions as ncRNA. Furthermore, ΔJpx is rescued by truncating Tsix, indicating an antagonistic relationship between the ncRNAs. We conclude that Xist is controlled by two RNA-based switches: Tsix for Xa and Jpx for Xi.},

To test the biological significance of the dual-binding specificity of MeCP2, we replaced its DNA binding domain with an orthologous domain from MBD2, which can only bind mCG motifs. Knockin mice expressing the domain-swap protein displayed severe Rett-syndrome-like phenotypes, indicating that normal brain function requires the interaction of MeCP2 with sites of non-CG methylation, specifically mCAC. The results support the notion that the delayed onset of Rett syndrome is due to the simultaneous post-natal accumulation of mCAC and its reader MeCP2. Intriguingly, genes dysregulated in both Mecp2 null and domain-swap mice are implicated in other neurological disorders, potentially highlighting targets of relevance to the Rett syndrome phenotype.},

In particular, granules found in germ cells have been used as a paradigm to study large and dynamic granules. These germ granules contain RNA and proteins required for germline development. Here, we unexpectedly identify large granules in specific subtypes of glial cells ("glial granules") of the adult Drosophila brain which contain polypeptides with previously characterized roles in germ cells including scaffold Tudor, Vasa, Polar granule component and Piwi family proteins. Interestingly, our super-resolution microscopy analysis shows that in the glial granules, these proteins form distinct partially overlapping clusters. Furthermore, we show that glial granule scaffold protein Tudor functions in silencing of transposable elements and in small regulatory piRNA biogenesis. Remarkably, our data indicate that the adult brain contains a small population of cells, which express both neuroblast and germ cell proteins. These distinct cells are evolutionarily conserved and expand during aging suggesting the existence of age-dependent signaling. Our work uncovers previously unknown glial granules and indicates the involvement of their components in the regulation of brain transcriptome.}

  abstract = {The biology of aging is focused on the identification of novel pathways that regulate the underlying processes of aging to develop interventions aimed at delaying the onset and progression of chronic diseases to extend lifespan. However, the research on the aging field has been conducted mainly in animal models, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and cell cultures. Thus, it is unclear to what extent this knowledge is transferable to humans since they might not reflect the complexity of aging in people. An organoid culture is an in vitro 3D cell-culture technology that reproduces the physiological and cellular composition of the tissues and/or organs. This technology is being used in the cancer field to predict the response of a patient-derived tumor to a certain drug or treatment serving as patient stratification and drug-guidance approaches. Modeling aging with patient-derived organoids has a tremendous potential as a preclinical model tool to discover new biomarkers of aging, to predict adverse outcomes during aging, and to design personalized approaches for the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases and geriatric syndromes. This could represent a novel approach to study chronological and/or biological aging, paving the way to personalized interventions targeting the biology of aging.},

  abstract = {Our perception of the role of the previously considered 'selfish' or 'junk' DNA has been dramatically altered in the past 20 years or so. A large proportion of this non-coding part of mammalian genomes is repetitive in nature, classified as either satellites or transposons. While repetitive elements can be termed selfish in terms of their amplification, such events have surely been co-opted by the host, suggesting by itself a likely altruistic function for the organism at the subject of such natural selection. Indeed numerous examples of transposons regulating the functional output of the host genome have been documented. Transposons provide a powerful framework for large-scale relatively rapid concerted regulatory activities with the ability to drive evolution. Mammalian totipotency has emerged as one key stage of development in which transposon-mediated regulation of gene expression has taken centre stage in the past few years. During this period, large-scale (epigenetic) reprogramming must be accomplished in order to activate the host genome. In mice and men, one particular element murine endogenous retrovirus with leucine tRNA primer (MERVL) (and its counterpart human ERVL (HERVL)) appears to have acquired roles as a key driving force in this process. Here, I will discuss and interpret the current knowledge and its implications regarding the role of transposons, particularly of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1s) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), in the regulation of totipotency. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation'.},

  abstract = {Biological sex profoundly conditions organismal development and physiology, imposing wide-ranging effects on cell signaling, metabolism, and immune response. These effects arise from sex-specified differences in hormonal exposure, and from intrinsic genetic and epigenetic differences associated with the presence of an XX versus XY chromosomal complement. In addition, biological sex is now recognized to be a determinant of the incidence, presentation, and therapeutic response of multiple forms of cancer, including cancers not specifically associated with male or female anatomy. While multiple factors contribute to sex-based differences in cancer, a growing body of research emphasizes a role for differential activity of X- and Y- linked tumor suppressor genes in males and females. Among these, the X-linked KDM6A/UTX and KDM5C/JARID1C/SMCX, and their Y-linked paralogs UTY/KDM6C and KDM5D/JARID1D/SMCY encode lysine demethylases. These epigenetic modulators profoundly influence gene expression, based on enzymatic activity in demethylating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, and non-enzymatic scaffolding roles for large complexes that open and close chromatin for transcription. In a growing number of cases, mutations affecting these proteins have been recognized to strongly influence cancer risk, prognosis, and response to specific therapies. However, sex-specific patterns of mutation, expression, and activity of these genes, coupled with tissue-specific requirement for their function as tumor suppressors, together exemplify the complex relationship between sex and cancer vulnerabilities. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current state of the literature on the roles of these proteins in contributing to sex bias in cancer, and the status of clinical agents relevant to their function.}

  abstract = {In females, most genes on the inactive X Chromosome (Chr) are transcriptionally silenced. However, several dozen genes have been identified in human that escape inactivation and are expressed from both the active and inactive X Chrs. Many of the genes that escape inactivation in human are subject to inactivation in mouse, raising questions concerning the mechanisms that govern expression from the inactive X Chr in the two species. In human, the existence of a cluster of genes in Xp11.21-p11.22 that escape inactivation suggests that control of X inactivation occurs at the level of chromosomal domains. In this study, we have isolated, physically mapped, and determined the X inactivation status of a number of the orthologous mouse genes that correspond to this human "escape domain". In contrast to human, only the mouse Smcx gene has been found to escape inactivation in this region thus far, despite a highly conserved physical map between the two species. Sequence analysis and functional characterization of the mouse Smcx promoter did not reveal any obvious unique features that would explain the difference in the behavior of this gene on the inactive X compared with other nearby genes. Possible mechanisms responsible for the differing inactivation status between genes in the escape domain in human Xp11. 21-p11.22 and the corresponding mouse region are discussed.},

We identified several new transcripts from this region in human and in mouse, which defined the full extent of the domain escaping X inactivation in both species. In human, escape from X inactivation involves an uninterrupted 235-kb domain of multiple genes. Despite highly conserved gene content and order between the two species, Smcx is the only mouse gene from the conserved segment that escapes inactivation. As repetitive sequences are believed to facilitate spreading of X inactivation along the chromosome, we compared the repetitive sequence composition of this region between the two species. We found that long terminal repeats (LTRs) were decreased in the human domain of escape, but not in the majority of the conserved mouse region adjacent to Smcx in which genes were subject to X inactivation, suggesting that these repeats might be excluded from escape domains to prevent spreading of silencing. Our findings indicate that genomic context, as well as gene-specific regulatory elements, interact to determine expression of a gene from the inactive X-chromosome.},

Lineage-specific deletion of the gene indicated that the Rett-like phenotype is caused by Mecp2 deficiency in neurons. Biochemical evidence suggests that Mecp2 acts as a global transcriptional repressor, predicting that mutant mice should have genome-wide transcriptional deregulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing global gene expression in wild-type and Mecp2 mutant mice. The results of numerous microarray analyses revealed no dramatic changes in transcription even in mice displaying overt disease symptoms, although statistical power analyses of the data indicated that even a small number of relatively subtle changes in transcription would have been detected if present. However, a classifier consisting of a combined small set of genes was able to distinguish between mutant and wild-type samples with high accuracy. This result suggests that Mecp2 deficiency leads to subtle gene expression changes in mutant brains which may be associated with the phenotypic changes observed.},

In genome-scale experiments comparing brief and sustained activity patterns, we reveal that activity-duration history can be inferred from gene expression profiles. Brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the activity-regulated gene program that corresponds to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. Induction of these first-wave genes is mechanistically distinct from that of the later waves because it requires MAPK/ERK signaling but does not require de novo translation. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of gene induction also enable different gene sets to be induced by different activity durations.},

The degree of mental retardation in the affected males ranged from mild to severe, and some patients suffered from additional disorders such as epilepsy, short stature, or behavioral problems.

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell type- and time point-specific gene expression programs. Evolution of enhancer sequences can alter target gene expression without causing detrimental misexpression in other contexts. It has long been thought that this modularity allows evolutionary changes in enhancers to escape pleiotropic constraints, which is especially important for evolutionary constrained developmental patterning genes. However, there is still little data supporting this hypothesis. Here we identified signatures of accelerated evolution in conserved enhancer elements across the mammalian phylogeny. We found that pleiotropic genes involved in gene regulatory and developmental processes were enriched for accelerated sequence evolution within their enhancer elements. These genes were associated with an excess number of enhancers compared to other genes, and due to this they exhibit a substantial degree of sequence acceleration over all their enhancers combined. We provide evidence that sequence acceleration is associated with turnover of regulatory function. We studied one acceleration event in depth and found that its sequence evolution led to the emergence of a new enhancer activity domain that may be involved in the evolution of digit reduction in hoofed mammals. Our results provide tangible evidence that enhancer evolution has been a frequent contributor to modifications involving constrained developmental signaling genes in mammals.},

We screened {$>$}32,000 human-specific substitutions in two classes of putative transcriptional enhancers implicated in human evolution for their effects on enhancer activity in human neural stem cells, a cell type fundamental for cortical development and expansion. We identify hundreds of substitutions that modify enhancer activity either alone or in combination with other variants. We find different patterns of substitution effects in different enhancer types. Our data support substitutions often interacting by modifying the same transcription factor binding sites. The functional substitutions we identify provide a rich set of candidate loci for studies of human-specific regulatory evolution.           ,              Genetic changes that altered the function of gene regulatory elements have been implicated in the evolution of human traits such as the expansion of the cerebral cortex. However, identifying the particular changes that modified regulatory activity during human evolution remain challenging. Here we used massively parallel enhancer assays in neural stem cells to quantify the functional impact of {$>$}32,000 human-specific substitutions in {$>$}4,300 human accelerated regions (HARs) and human gain enhancers (HGEs), which include enhancers with novel activities in humans. We found that {$>$}30\% of active HARs and HGEs exhibited differential activity between human and chimpanzee. We isolated the effects of human-specific substitutions from background genetic variation to identify the effects of genetic changes most relevant to human evolution. We found that substitutions interacted in both additive and nonadditive ways to modify enhancer function. Substitutions within HARs, which are highly constrained compared to HGEs, showed smaller effects on enhancer activity, suggesting that the impact of human-specific substitutions is buffered in enhancers with constrained ancestral functions. Our findings yield insight into how human-specific genetic changes altered enhancer function and provide a rich set of candidates for studies of regulatory evolution in humans.},

Both sex chromosomes appear enriched for genes related to sexual differentiation and reproduction; but curiously, the human X chromosome also seems to bear a preponderance of genes linked to brain and muscle functions. In this review, we will synthesize several evolutionary theories that may account for this nonrandom assortment of genes on the sex chromosomes, including 1) asexual degeneration, 2) sexual antagonism, 3) constant selection, and 4) hemizygous exposure. Additionally, we will speculate on how the evolution of sex‐chromosome gene content might have impacted on the phenotypic evolution of mammals and particularly humans.

Despite opposite enzymatic activities, the two mouse models deficient for either Kmt2a or Kdm5c shared reduced dendritic spines and increased aggression. Double mutation of Kmt2a and Kdm5c clearly reversed dendritic morphology, key behavioral traits including aggression, and partially corrected altered transcriptomes and H3K4me landscapes.

Prominent examples are genes involved in synaptic plasticity, Ras and Rho GTPase signaling, and epigenetic genes that encode modifiers of the chromatin structure.

  abstract = {Transcriptional dysregulation is an early feature of Huntington disease (HD). We observed gene-specific changes in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at transcriptionally repressed promoters in R6/2 mouse and human HD brain. Genome-wide analysis showed a chromatin signature for this mark. Reducing the levels of the H3K4 demethylase SMCX/Jarid1c in primary neurons reversed down-regulation of key neuronal genes caused by mutant Huntingtin expression. Finally, reduction of SMCX/Jarid1c in primary neurons from BACHD mice or the single Jarid1 in a Drosophila HD model was protective. Therefore, targeting this epigenetic signature may be an effective strategy to ameliorate the consequences of HD.},

  abstract = {Adenosine, through A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) activation, can act as a metamodulator, controlling the actions of other modulators, as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Most of the metamodulatory actions of adenosine in the hippocampus have been evaluated in excitatory synapses. However, adenosine and BDNF can also influence GABAergic transmission. We thus evaluated the role of A(2A)R on the modulatory effect of BDNF upon glutamate and GABA release from isolated hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes). BDNF (30 ng/ml) enhanced K(+)-evoked [(3)H]glutamate release and inhibited the K(+)-evoked [(3)H]GABA release from synaptosomes. The effect of BDNF on both glutamate and GABA release requires tonic activation of adenosine A(2A)R since for both neurotransmitters, the BDNF action was blocked by the A(2A)R antagonist SCH 58261 (50 nM). In the presence of the A(2A)R agonist, CGS21680 (30 nM), the effect of BDNF on either glutamate or GABA release was, however, not potentiated. It is concluded that both the inhibitory actions of BDNF on GABA release as well as the facilitatory action of the neurotrophin on glutamate release are dependent on the activation of adenosine A(2A)R by endogenous adenosine. However, these actions could not be further enhanced by exogenous activation of A(2A)R.},

The majority of CpG sites in mammalian cells is methylated in a nonrandom fashion, raising the question of how DNA methylation is distributed along the genome. Here, we focused on the functions of DNA methyltransferase-3b (Dnmt3b), of which deregulated activity is linked to several human pathologies. We generated Dnmt3b hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced catalytic activity, which first revealed a deregulation of Hox genes expression, consistent with the observed homeotic transformations of the posterior axis. In addition, analysis of deregulated expression programs in Dnmt3b mutant embryos, using DNA microarrays, highlighted illegitimate activation of several germ-line genes in somatic tissues that appeared to be linked directly to their hypomethylation in mutant embryos. We provide evidence that these genes are direct targets of Dnmt3b. Moreover, the recruitment of Dnmt3b to their proximal promoter is dependant on the binding of the E2F6 transcriptional repressor, which emerges as a common hallmark in the promoters of genes found to be up-regulated as a consequence of impaired Dnmt3b activity. Therefore, our results unraveled a coordinated regulation of genes involved in meiosis, through E2F6-dependant methylation and transcriptional silencing in somatic tissues.},

Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic screening we show that the basal transcription factor TFIID directly binds to the H3K4me3 mark via the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of TAF3. Selective loss of H3K4me3 reduces transcription from and TFIID binding to a subset of promoters in vivo. Equilibrium binding assays and competition experiments show that the TAF3 PHD finger is highly selective for H3K4me3. In transient assays, TAF3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator in a PHD finger-dependent manner. Interestingly, asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 selectively inhibits TFIID binding to H3K4me3, whereas acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates TFIID interaction. Our experiments reveal crosstalk between histone modifications and the transcription factor TFIID. This has important implications for regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in higher eukaryotes.},

The outer repeats at fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) centromeres are heterochromatic and are required for the assembly of an active centromere. Components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery process transcripts derived from these repeats and mediate the formation of silent chromatin. A subfragment of the repeat (dg) is known to induce silencing of marker genes at euchromatic sites and is required for centromere formation. We show that the RNAi components, Argonaute (Ago1), Dicer (Dcr1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdp1), are required to maintain silencing, lysine 9 methylation of histone H3 and association of Swi6 via this dg ectopic silencer. Deletion of Ago1, Dcr1 or Rdp1 disrupts chromosome segregation leading to a high incidence of lagging chromosomes on late anaphase spindles and sensitivity to a microtubule poison. Analysis of dg transcription indicates that csp mutants, previously shown to abrogate centromere silencing and chromosome segregation, are also defective in the regulation of non-coding centromeric RNAs. In addition, histone H3 lysine 9 methylation at, and recruitment of Swi6 and cohesin to, centromeric repeats is disrupted in these mutants. Thus the formation of silent chromatin on dg repeats and the development of a fully functional centromere is dependent on RNAi.},

  abstract = {The correct establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns are critical for mammalian development and the control of normal cell growth and differentiation. DNA methylation has profound effects on the mammalian genome, including transcriptional repression, modulation of chromatin structure, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and the suppression of the detrimental effects of repetitive and parasitic DNA sequences on genome integrity. Consistent with its essential role in normal cells and predominance at repetitive genomic regions, aberrant changes of DNA methylation patterns are a common feature of diseases with chromosomal and genomic instabilities. In this context, the functions of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) can be affected by mutations or alterations of their expression. DNMT3B, which is involved in de novo methylation, is of particular interest not only because of its important role in development, but also because of its dysfunction in human diseases. Expression of catalytically inactive isoforms has been associated with cancer risk and germ line hypomorphic mutations with the ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency Centromeric instability Facial anomalies). In these diseases, global genomic hypomethylation affects repeated sequences around centromeric regions, which make up large blocks of heterochromatin, and is associated with chromosome instability, impaired chromosome segregation and perturbed nuclear architecture. The review will focus on recent data about the function of DNMT3B, and the consequences of its deregulated activity on pathological DNA hypomethylation, including the illicit activation of germ line-specific genes and accumulation of transcripts originating from repeated satellite sequences, which may represent novel physiopathological biomarkers for human diseases. Notably, we focus on cancer and the ICF syndrome, pathological contexts in which hypomethylation has been extensively characterized. We also discuss the potential contribution of these deregulated protein-coding and non-coding transcription programs to the perturbation of cellular phenotypes.}

Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells as a model system, we show that acute ablation of shared subunits of the SET1/COMPASS complexes leads to a complete loss of all H3K4 methylation. Turnover of~H3K4me3 occurs more rapidly than that of~H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 and is dependent on KDM5 demethylases. Notably, acute loss of H3K4me3 does not have detectable effects on transcriptional initiation but leads to a widespread decrease in transcriptional output, an increase in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing and slower elongation. We show that H3K4me3 is required for the recruitment of the integrator complex subunit 11 (INTS11), which is essential for the eviction of paused RNAPII and transcriptional elongation. Thus, our study demonstrates a distinct role for H3K4me3 in transcriptional pause-release and elongation rather than transcriptional initiation.},

However, the origin and function of H-Y antigens has eluded researchers for 40 years. One human H-Y antigen presented by HLA-B7 was identified as an 11-residue peptide derived from SMCY, an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded on the Y chromosome. The protein from the homologous gene on the X chromosome, SMCX, differs by two amino acid residues in the same region. The identification of H-Y may aid in transplantation prognosis, prenatal diagnosis, and fertilization strategies.},

  abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate intercellular communication by transferring cargo between cells in a variety of tissues. However, how EVs achieve cell-type-specific intercellular communication is still largely unknown. We found that Notch1 and Notch2 proteins are expressed on the surface of neuronal EVs that have been generated in response to neuronal excitatory synaptic activity. Notch ligands bind these EVs on the neuronal plasma membrane, trigger their internalization, activate the Notch signaling pathway, and drive the expression of Notch target genes. The generation of these neuronal EVs requires the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-associated protein Alix. Adult Alix conditional knockout mice have reduced hippocampal Notch signaling activation and glutamatergic synaptic protein expression. Thus, EVs facilitate neuron-to-neuron communication via the Notch receptor-ligand system in the brain.},

  abstract = {Covalent modification of histones is important in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription. One example of such modification is ubiquitination, which mainly occurs on histones H2A and H2B. Although recent studies have uncovered the enzymes involved in histone H2B ubiquitination and a 'cross-talk' between H2B ubiquitination and histone methylation, the responsible enzymes and the functions of H2A ubiquitination are unknown. Here we report the purification and functional characterization of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is specific for histone H2A. The complex, termed hPRC1L (human Polycomb repressive complex 1-like), is composed of several Polycomb-group proteins including Ring1, Ring2, Bmi1 and HPH2. hPRC1L monoubiquitinates nucleosomal histone H2A at lysine 119. Reducing the expression of Ring2 results in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated colocalization of dRing with ubiquitinated H2A at the PRE and promoter regions of the Drosophila Ubx gene in wing imaginal discs. Removal of dRing in SL2 tissue culture cells by RNA interference resulted in loss of H2A ubiquitination concomitant with derepression of Ubx. Thus, our studies identify the H2A ubiquitin ligase, and link H2A ubiquitination to Polycomb silencing.},

  abstract = {Results of a previous study showed that angiotensin II (AII) inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal granule cells in response to dorsomedial perforant path stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats. The results of present experiments demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of LTP induction under the same conditions due to ethanol (EtOH) administered by stomach tube and diazepam (DZ) injected IP. The inhibition of LTP induction by EtOH and DZ can be blocked by saralasin (SAR) applied directly to the dorsal hippocampus and by lorsartan (DuP 753) administered IP. Lorsartan or a metabolite crosses the blood-brain barrier because it also blocks the inhibition of LTP induction due to AII administration directly into the dorsal hippocampus. Lorsartan is a competitive antagonist of the AT1 subtype AII receptor. Therefore, the AII and the EtOH and DZ inhibition of LTP induction are mediated by the AII subtype receptor AT1. AIII and the AT2 antagonist PD123319 did not produce any significant effects. These in vivo effects can be reproduced in brain slices and therefore cannot be attributed to other factors, such as the urethane. In addition, electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) inhibits LTP induction, and the inhibition can be blocked by SAR. These data on LH stimulation indicate that LH AII-containing neurons send axons into the hippocampus that inhibit the induction of LTP. These results not only provide new information on a neurotransmitter involved in the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines and ethanol-induced memory blackouts, but also testable hypotheses concerning recent observations that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors elevate mood and improve certain cognitive processes in the elderly.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            MYT1L is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-associated transcription factor that is expressed in virtually all neurons throughout life. How               MYT1L               mutations cause neurological phenotypes and whether they can be targeted remains enigmatic. Here, we examine the effects of MYT1L deficiency in human neurons and mice. Mutant mice exhibit neurodevelopmental delays with thinner cortices, behavioural phenotypes, and gene expression changes that resemble those of ASD patients. MYT1L target genes, including               WNT               and               NOTCH               , are activated upon MYT1L depletion and their chemical inhibition can rescue delayed neurogenesis in vitro. MYT1L deficiency also causes upregulation of the main cardiac sodium channel,               SCN5A               , and neuronal hyperactivity, which could be restored by shRNA-mediated knockdown of               SCN5A               or               MYT1L               overexpression in postmitotic neurons. Acute application of the sodium channel blocker, lamotrigine, also rescued electrophysiological defects in vitro and behaviour phenotypes in vivo. Hence,               MYT1L               mutation causes both developmental and postmitotic neurological defects. However, acute intervention can normalise resulting electrophysiological and behavioural phenotypes in adulthood.},

We identify 27 recurrent DSB clusters (RDCs), and remarkably, all occur within gene bodies. Most of these NSPC RDCs were detected only upon mild, aphidicolin-induced replication stress, providing a nucleotide-resolution view of replication-associated genomic fragile sites. The vast majority of RDCs occur in long, transcribed, and late-replicating genes. Moreover, almost 90\% of identified RDC-containing genes are involved in synapse function and/or neural cell adhesion, with a substantial fraction also implicated in tumor suppression and/or mental disorders. Our characterization of NSPC RDCs reveals a basis of gene fragility and suggests potential impacts of DNA breaks on neurodevelopment and neural functions.},

To better understand how the patient mutations affect neuronal development, we expressed KDM5C mutants in Neuro2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Retinoic acid (RA)-induced neurite growth was suppressed by the mutation KDM5C (Y751C) , KDM5C (H514A) , and KDM5C (F642L) , but not KDM5C (D87G) or KDM5C (A388P) . RNA-seq analysis indicated an upregulation of genes important for neuronal development, such as Ntng2, Enah, Gas1, Slit2, and Dscam, in response to the RA treatment in control Neuro2a cells transfected with GFP or wild-type KDM5C. In contrast, in cells transfected with KDM5C (Y751C) , these genes were not upregulated by RA. Ntng2 was downregulated in cells with KDM5C mutations, concordant with the lower levels of H3K4 methylation at its promoter. Moreover, knocking down Ntng2 in control Neuro2a cells led to the phenotype of short neurites similar to that of cells with KDM5C (Y751C) , whereas Ntng2 overexpression in the mutant cells rescued the morphological phenotype. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of phenotypes associated with KDM5C mutations.},

  abstract = {Cys2-His2 zinc finger genes (ZNFs) form the largest family of transcription factors in metazoans. ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that, in tetrapods, the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a critical role in the evolution of the Krüppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily. Currently, it is unknown whether this function and coevolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs or is a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver of the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from 3221 genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in diverse animal species. We further investigate the largest ZNF subfamily found in cyprinid fish, which is characterized by a conserved sequence we dubbed the fish N-terminal zinc finger–associated (FiNZ) domain. Zebrafish possess approximately 700 FiNZ-ZNFs, many of which are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, most zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed at the onset of zygotic genome activation, and blocking their translation using morpholinos during early embryogenesis results in derepression of transcriptionally active TEs. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution.},

They carry out essential and contrasting functions within cellular mechanisms, underlining their critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The specific cellular context that dictates R-loop formation determines their function, particularly emphasizing the necessity for their meticulous genomic regulation. Notably, the aberrant formation or misregulation of R-loops is implicated in numerous neurological disorders. This review focuses on the complex interactions between R-loops and double-strand DNA breaks, exploring how R-loop dysregulation potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of various brain disorders, which could provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning neurological disease progression and identify potential therapeutic targets by highlighting these aspects.           ,              Plane language summary             R-loops are special structures inside our cells, made when a piece of RNA (a molecule similar to DNA) sticks to DNA, exposing a part of the DNA.

However, when these R-loops do not form correctly or are not controlled well by the cell, they can cause problems. This is especially true in the brain, where mistakes in R-loop formation can lead to various neurological disorders, which are conditions that affect the brain and nerves.

  abstract = {Tumor cells frequently exhibit widespread epigenetic aberrations that significantly alter the repertoire of expressed proteins. In particular, it has been known for nearly 25 years that tumors frequently reactivate genes whose expression is typically restricted to germ cells. These gene products are classified as cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) owing to their biased expression pattern and their immunogenicity in cancer patients. While these genes have been pursued as targets for anticancer vaccines, whether these reactivated testis proteins have roles in supporting tumorigenic features is less studied. Recent evidence now indicates that these proteins can be directly employed by the tumor cell regulatory environment to support cell-autonomous behaviors. Here, we review the history of the CTA field and present recent findings indicating that CTAs can play functional roles in supporting tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors and chromatin modifiers are important in the programming and reprogramming of cellular states during development. Transcription factors bind to enhancer elements and recruit coactivators and chromatin-modifying enzymes to facilitate transcription initiation. During differentiation a subset of these enhancers must be silenced, but the mechanisms underlying enhancer silencing are poorly understood. Here we show that the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; ref. 5), which demethylates histone H3 on Lys 4 or Lys 9 (H3K4/K9), is essential in decommissioning enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). LSD1 occupies enhancers of active genes that are critical for control of the state of ESCs. However, LSD1 is not essential for the maintenance of ESC identity. Instead, ESCs lacking LSD1 activity fail to differentiate fully, and ESC-specific enhancers fail to undergo the histone demethylation events associated with differentiation. At active enhancers, LSD1 is a component of the NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase) complex, which contains additional subunits that are necessary for ESC differentiation. We propose that the LSD1-NuRD complex decommissions enhancers of the pluripotency program during differentiation, which is essential for the complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program and the transition to new cell states.},

These idiosyncratic loci are known as imprinted genes, and their existence is an evolutionary enigma, as they effectively nullify the advantages of diploidy.

  abstract = {Midkines are heparin-binding growth factors involved in a wide range of biological processes. Originally identified as retinoic acid inducible genes, midkines are widely expressed during embryogenesis with particularly high levels in the developing nervous system. During postnatal stages, midkine expression generally ceases but is often up-regulated under disease conditions, most notably those affecting the nervous system. Midkines are known as neurotrophic factors, as they promote neurite outgrowth and neuron survival in cell culture. Surprisingly, however, mouse embryos deficient for midkine (knockout mice) are phenotypically normal, which suggests functional redundancy by related growth factors. During adult stages, on the other hand, midkine knockout mice develop striking deficits in neuroprotection and regeneration after drug-induced neurotoxicity and injury. The detailed mechanisms by which midkine controls neuron formation, differentiation and maintenance remain unclear. Recent studies in zebrafish and chick have provided important insight into the role of midkine and its putative receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, in cell cycle control in the central and peripheral nervous systems. A recent structural analysis of zebrafish midkine furthermore revealed essential protein domains required for biological activity that serve as promising novel targets for future drug designs. This review will summarize latest findings in the field that help to better understand the diverse roles of midkine in nervous system formation and maintenance.|This article is part of a themed section on Midkine.

The present study employed radioimmunoassay to quantitate the level of galanin peptide overexpression in two brain regions relevant to learning and memory, the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Approximately 4-fold higher levels of galanin were detected in the hippocampus of GAL-tg as compared to WT. Approximately 10-fold higher levels of galanin were detected in the frontal cortex of GAL-tg as compared to WT. A second cohort of GAL-tg and WT again showed high levels of galanin overexpression in GAL-tg as compared to WT in both brain regions. Correlation analyses were conducted between galanin peptide concentrations and behavioral scores on four learning and memory tasks: the Morris water maze, social transmission of food preference, standard delay fear conditioning, and trace fear conditioning. While some significant correlations were detected, neither hippocampal nor cortical galanin levels in the two cohorts of GAL-tg consistently correlated with performance across these diverse cognitive tasks. Several interpretations of these findings are discussed, including the possibility that a threshold level of galanin overexpression is sufficient to impair performance on learning and memory tasks in mice.},

Circulating testosterone activates the androgen receptor (AR) and is also converted into estrogen in the brain via aromatase. We demonstrate extensive sexual dimorphism in the number and projections of aromatase-expressing neurons. The masculinization of these cells is independent of AR but can be induced in females by either testosterone or estrogen, indicating a role for aromatase in sexual differentiation of these neurons. We provide evidence suggesting that aromatase is also important in activating male-specific aggression and urine marking because these behaviors can be elicited by testosterone in males mutant for AR and in females subjected to neonatal estrogen exposure. Our results suggest that aromatization of testosterone into estrogen is important for the development and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors.},

CTCF genomic localization is controlled by the recognition of a DNA sequence motif and regulated by DNA modifications. However, CTCF does not bind to all its potential sites in all cell types, raising the question of whether the underlying chromatin structure can regulate CTCF occupancy. Here, we report that R-loops facilitate CTCF binding through the formation of associated G-quadruplex (G4) structures. R-loops and G4s co-localize with CTCF at many genomic regions in mouse embryonic stem cells and promote CTCF binding to its cognate DNA motif in vitro. R-loop attenuation reduces CTCF binding in vivo. Deletion of a specific G4-forming motif in a gene reduces CTCF binding and alters gene expression. Conversely, chemical stabilization of G4s results in CTCF gains and accompanying alterations in chromatin organization, suggesting a pivotal role for G4 structures in reinforcing long-range genome interactions through CTCF.},

  abstract = {The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor acts with a number of chromatin cofactors in a wide range of species to suppress cell proliferation. The Caenorhabditis elegans retinoblastoma gene and many of these cofactors, called synMuv B genes, were identified in genetic screens for cell lineage defects caused by growth factor misexpression. Mutations in many synMuv B genes, including lin-35/Rb, also cause somatic misexpression of the germline RNA processing P granules and enhanced RNAi. We show here that multiple small RNA components, including a set of germline-specific Argonaute genes, are misexpressed in the soma of many synMuv B mutant animals, revealing one node for enhanced RNAi. Distinct classes of synMuv B mutants differ in the subcellular architecture of their misexpressed P granules, their profile of misexpressed small RNA and P granule genes, as well as their enhancement of RNAi and the related silencing of transgenes. These differences define three classes of synMuv B genes, representing three chromatin complexes: a LIN-35/Rb-containing DRM core complex, a SUMO-recruited Mec complex, and a synMuv B heterochromatin complex, suggesting that intersecting chromatin pathways regulate the repression of small RNA and P granule genes in the soma and the potency of RNAi. Consistent with this, the DRM complex and the synMuv B heterochromatin complex were genetically additive and displayed distinct antagonistic interactions with the MES-4 histone methyltransferase and the MRG-1 chromodomain protein, two germline chromatin regulators required for the synMuv phenotype and the somatic misexpression of P granule components. Thus intersecting synMuv B chromatin pathways conspire with synMuv B suppressor chromatin factors to regulate the expression of small RNA pathway genes, which enables heightened RNAi response. Regulation of small RNA pathway genes by human retinoblastoma may also underlie its role as a tumor suppressor gene.},

To better understand how this occurs, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of young and old mouse brains after parabiosis. For each cell type, we cataloged alterations in gene expression, molecular pathways, transcriptional networks, ligand–receptor interactions and senescence status. Our analyses identified gene signatures, demonstrating that heterochronic parabiosis regulates several hallmarks of aging in a cell-type-specific manner. Brain endothelial cells were found to be especially malleable to this intervention, exhibiting dynamic transcriptional changes that affect vascular structure and function.

Current cellular models for AD often require several months to exhibit phenotypic features due to the lack of an aging environment in vitro. Lamin A is a key component of the nuclear lamina. Progerin, a truncated protein resulting from specific lamin A mutations, causes Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a disease that prematurely ages individuals. Studies have reported that lamin A expression is induced in the brains of AD patients, and overlapping cellular phenotypes have been observed between HGPS and AD cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous progerin expression on neural progenitor cells carrying familial AD mutations (FAD). Within three to four weeks of differentiation, these cells exhibited robust AD phenotypes, including increased tau phosphorylation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and an elevated Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio. Additionally, progerin expression significantly increased AD cellular phenotypes such as cell death and cell cycle re-entry. Our results suggest that progerin expression could be used to create an accelerated model for AD development and drug screening.},

  abstract = {Conserved genomic sequences disrupted in humans may underlie uniquely human phenotypic traits. We identified and characterized 10,032 human-specific conserved deletions (hCONDELs). These short (average 2.56 base pairs) deletions are enriched for human brain functions across genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic datasets. Using massively parallel reporter assays in six cell types, we discovered 800 hCONDELs conferring significant differences in regulatory activity, half of which enhance rather than disrupt regulatory function. We highlight several hCONDELs with putative human-specific effects on brain development, including               HDAC5               ,               CPEB4               , and               PPP2CA               . Reverting an hCONDEL to the ancestral sequence alters the expression of               LOXL2               and developmental genes involved in myelination and synaptic function. Our data provide a rich resource to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms driving new traits in humans and other species.                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               Deciphering the molecular and genetic changes that differentiate humans from our closest primate relatives is critical for understanding our origins. Although earlier studies have prioritized how newly gained genetic sequences or variations have contributed to evolutionary innovation, the role of sequence loss has been less appreciated. Alterations in evolutionary conserved regions that are enriched for biological function could be particularly more likely to have phenotypic effects. We thus sought to identify and characterize sequences that have been conserved across evolution, but are then surprisingly lost in all humans. These human-specific deletions in conserved regions (hCONDELs) may play an important role in uniquely human traits.                                         RATIONALE               Sequencing advancements have identified millions of genetic changes between chimpanzee and human genomes; however, the functional impacts of the \textasciitilde 1 to 5\% difference between our species is largely unknown. hCONDELs are one class of these predominantly noncoding sequence changes. Although large hCONDELs ({$>$}1 kb) have been previously identified, the vast majority of all hCONDELs (95.7\%) are small ({$<$}20 base pairs) and have not yet been functionally assessed. We adapted massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to characterize the effects of thousands of these small hCONDELs and uncovered hundreds with functional effects. By understanding the effects of these hCONDELs, we can gain insight into the mechanistic patterns driving evolution in the human genome.                                         RESULTS               We identified 10,032 hCONDELs by examining conserved regions across diverse vertebrate genomes and overlapping with confidently annotated, human-specific fixed deletions. We found that these hCONDELs are enriched to delete conserved sequences originating from stem amniotes. Overlap with transcriptional, epigenomic, and phenotypic datasets all implicate neuronal and cognitive functional impacts. We characterized these hCONDELs using MPRA in six different human cell types, including induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitor cells. We found that 800 hCONDELs displayed species-specific regulatory effect effects. Although many hCONDELs perturb transcription factor–binding sites in active enhancers, we estimate that 30\% create or improve binding sites, including activators and repressors.                                Some hCONDELs exhibit molecular functions that affect core neurodevelopmental genes. One hCONDEL removes a single base in an active enhancer in the neurogenesis gene                 HDAC5                 , and another deletes six bases in an alternative promoter of                 PPP2CA                 , a gene that regulates neuronal signaling. We deeply characterized an hCONDEL in a putative regulatory element of                 LOXL2                 , a gene that controls neuronal differentiation. Using genome engineering to reintroduce the conserved chimpanzee sequence into human cells, we confirmed that the human deletion alters transcriptional output of                 LOXL2                 . Single-cell RNA sequencing of these cells uncovered a cascade of myelination and synaptic function–related transcriptional changes induced by the hCONDEL.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our identification of hundreds of hCONDELs with functional impacts reveals new molecular changes that may have shaped our unique biological lineage. These hCONDELs display predicted functions in a variety of biological systems but are especially enriched for function in neuronal tissue. Many hCONDELs induced gains of regulatory activity, a surprising discovery given that deletions of conserved bases are commonly thought to abrogate function. Our work provides a paradigm for the characterization of nucleotide changes shaping species-specific biology across humans or other animals.                                                   Human-specific deletions that remove nucleotides from regions highly conserved in other animals (hCONDELs).                                        We assessed 10,032 hCONDELs across diverse, biologically relevant datasets and identified tissue-specific enrichment (top left). The regulatory impact of hCONDELs was characterized by comparing chimp and human sequences in MPRAs (bottom left). The ability of hCONDELs to either improve or perturb activating and repressing gene-regulatory elements was assessed (top right). The deleted chimpanzee sequence was reintroduced back into human cells, causing a cascade of transcriptional differences for an hCONDEL regulating                     LOXL2                     (bottom right).},

  abstract = {A major question is whether genes encoded on the sex chromosomes act directly in non-gonadal tissues to cause sex differences in development or function, or whether all sex differences in somatic tissues are induced by gonadal secretions. As part of this question we asked whether mouse X-Y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analysis, we assessed mRNA expression in brain of eight Y-linked genes as well as their X-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (P1) and adult. Transcripts of six Y genes were expressed at one or more ages: Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby. Their expression also occurred in XY female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. Six X-linked homologues (Usp9x, Ube1x, Smcx, Eif2s3x, Utx and Dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their X-inactivation status. For five of these gene pairs, the expression of the Y-linked homologue in males was not sufficient to compensate for the female bias in X gene expression. Three X-Y gene pairs, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/y and Eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent. These sex differences in X-Y gene expression suggest several mechanisms by which these genes may participate in sex differences in brain development and function.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) forms R-loops to promote homology-directed DNA synthesis in the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway. Here we report that TERRA contributes to ALT via interacting with the lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1 or KDM1A). We show that LSD1 localizes to ALT telomeres in a TERRA dependent manner and LSD1 function in ALT is largely independent of its demethylase activity. Instead, LSD1 promotes TERRA recruitment to ALT telomeres via RNA binding. In addition, LSD1 and TERRA undergo phase separation, driven by interactions between the RNA binding properties of LSD1 and the G-quadruplex structure of TERRA. Importantly, the formation of TERRA-LSD1 condensates enriches the R-loop stimulating protein Rad51AP1 and increases TERRA-containing R-loops at telomeres. Our findings suggest that LSD1-TERRA phase separation enhances the function of R-loop regulatory molecules for ALT telomere maintenance, providing a mechanism for how the biophysical properties of histone modification enzyme-RNA interactions impact chromatin function.},

We analyzed two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants, mia1 and mia2, which display slow swimming and low flagellar beat frequency. We found that the MIA1 and MIA2 genes encode conserved coiled-coil proteins, FAP100 and FAP73, respectively, which form the modifier of inner arms (MIA) complex in flagella. Cryo-electron tomography of mia mutant axonemes revealed that the MIA complex was located immediately distal to the intermediate/light chain complex of I1 dynein and structurally appeared to connect with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. In axonemes from mutants that lack both the outer dynein arms and the MIA complex, I1 dynein failed to assemble, suggesting physical interactions between these three axonemal complexes and a role for the MIA complex in the stable assembly of I1 dynein. The MIA complex appears to regulate I1 dynein and possibly outer arm dyneins, which are both essential for normal motility.},

  abstract = {We report a comprehensive analysis of gene expression differences between sexes in multiple somatic tissues of 334 mice derived from an intercross between inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ. The analysis of a large number of individuals provided the power to detect relatively small differences in expression between sexes, and the use of an intercross allowed analysis of the genetic control of sexually dimorphic gene expression. Microarray analysis of 23,574 transcripts revealed that the extent of sexual dimorphism in gene expression was much greater than previously recognized. Thus, thousands of genes showed sexual dimorphism in liver, adipose, and muscle, and hundreds of genes were sexually dimorphic in brain. These genes exhibited highly tissue-specific patterns of expression and were enriched for distinct pathways represented in the Gene Ontology database. They also showed evidence of chromosomal enrichment, not only on the sex chromosomes, but also on several autosomes. Genetic analyses provided evidence of the global regulation of subsets of the sexually dimorphic genes, as the transcript levels of a large number of these genes were controlled by several expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hotspots that exhibited tissue-specific control. Moreover, many tissue-specific transcription factor binding sites were found to be enriched in the sexually dimorphic genes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that accumulate on chromatin in neurological diseases and cancers and contribute to genome instability. Using a proximity-dependent labeling system, we identified distinct classes of proteins that regulate R-loops in vivo through different mechanisms. We show that ATRX suppresses R-loops by interacting with RNAs and preventing R-loop formation. Our proteomics screen also discovered an unexpected enrichment for proteins containing zinc fingers and homeodomains. One of the most consistently enriched proteins was activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), which is frequently mutated in ASD and causal in ADNP syndrome. We find that ADNP resolves R-loops in vitro and that it is necessary to suppress R-loops in vivo at its genomic targets. Furthermore, deletion of the ADNP homeodomain severely diminishes R-loop resolution activity in vitro, results in R-loop accumulation at ADNP targets, and compromises neuronal differentiation. Notably, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells that contain an ADNP syndrome-causing mutation exhibit R-loop and CTCF accumulation at ADNP targets. Our findings point to a specific role for ADNP-mediated R-loop resolution in physiological and pathological neuronal function and, more broadly, to a role for zinc finger and homeodomain proteins in R-loop regulation, with important implications for developmental disorders and cancers.},

Using in utero electroporation (IUE), we found that overexpression of Spag6 delayed the rate of neuronal migration, rather than affecting the ultimate fate of cortical neurons. Furthermore, overexpression of Spag6 caused a significant decrease in neurite number and length of cortical neurons. Our results indicated that Spag6 controlled neuronal migration as well as neurite branching and elongation.},

Here, we show that the absence of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) promotes aneuploidy in murine oocytes by inducing defective meiotic chromosome segregation. The abnormal oocyte karyotype is inherited by embryos, which die in utero at an early stage of development. In addition, embryo death in               SCP3               -deficient females increases with advancing maternal age.

Besides the floor plate, foxj1a is expressed in Kupffer's vesicle and pronephric ducts, where it also promotes ciliary differentiation. We show that Foxj1a activates a constellation of genes essential for motile cilia formation and function, and that its activity is sufficient for ectopic development of cilia that resemble motile cilia. We also document that a paralogous gene, foxj1b, is expressed in the otic vesicle and seems to regulate motile cilia formation in this tissue. Our findings identify a dedicated master regulatory role for Foxj1 in the transcriptional program that controls the production of motile cilia.},

PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase-derived gene with retained nuclease activity in human cells. Vertebrate brain development is known to be associated with prominent neuronal cell death and DNA breaks, but their causes and functions are not well understood. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, where its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement, and seizures. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of post-mitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic genome rearrangements. In the brain cortex, loss of Pgbd5 leads to aberrant differentiation and gene expression of distinct neuronal populations, including specific types of glutamatergic neurons, which explains the features of PGBD5 deficiency in humans. Thus, PGBD5 might be a transposase-derived enzyme required for brain development in mammals.

These two proteins are also expressed in other tissues containing ciliated cells, such as brain and lung. To study the effects of combined deficiency of these two proteins, a double mutant mouse model was created. The double mutant mice displayed a more profound phenotype of growth retardation and hydrocephalus compared to mice nullizygous for SPAG6 and SPAG16L alone. The double mutant mice died younger, and mortality was significantly higher than in single mutant mice. In addition, the double mutant mice demonstrated pneumonia and its complications, including hemorrhage, edema, and atelectasis, phenotypes not observed in mice nullizygous for mutations in the individual genes. No other cilia-related phenotypic change was detected in double mutant mice including lateralization defects. The ultrastructure of cilia in both the brain and lung of the double mutant mice appeared normal. This model of combined SPAG6 and SPAG16L deficiency provides a new platform to study primary ciliary dyskinesia. The findings also demonstrate that SPAG6 and SPAG16L have related roles in controlling the function of cilia in the brain and lung.},

The present study was designed to detect the expression of H3K4me1/2/3 and its demethylases LSD1, RBP2 and SMCX in 21-, 40- and 60-day-old mouse testes by using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated that the expression patterns of the same protein were similar in testes at different ages and that the positive staining cell types were mainly Leydig cells, type A and B spermatogonia, leptotene spermatocytes and spermatids for H3K4me1/2/3, Leydig cells, type A spermatogonia, zygotene and pachytene spermatocytes, spermatids, and Sertoli cells for LSD1 and type A and B spermatogonia for RBP2. Immunostaining for SMCX was not detected in testes. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot showed that the amounts of LSD1, RPB2 and SMCX mRNA and protein were age-dependent, were significantly reduced with increasing age and exhibited a negative correlation with the protein levels of H3K4me1/2/3. Thus, H3K4me, which is modified by its demethylases, probably plays a role in male spermatogenesis and testis development.},

  abstract = {PF20 was first identified in Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii as an essential component of the axoneme central apparatus. We discovered that the mouse Pf20 gene encodes two major transcripts (2.5 and 1.4 kb), which are expressed in different patterns during spermatogenesis, yielding proteins of 71 and 35 kDa, respectively. Both proteins contain contiguous WD repeats in their C termini. The meiotically expressed 71-kDa protein is incorporated into the central apparatus, whereas the 35-kDa protein, which accumulates in postmeiotic male germ cells, is abundant in the nucleus. We disrupted the Pf20 gene domains that encode the C-terminal WD repeats in embryonic stem cells. Highly chimeric mice carrying the mutant Pf20 allele had impaired spermatogenesis with a significant loss of germ cells at the round spermatid stage, in association with disorganization of sperm axoneme structure. The mutated Pf20 allele was never transmitted, indicating that Pf20 haploinsufficiency caused the defects in spermatogenesis. The 35-kDa PF20 protein was shown to bind to meiosis-expressed gene 1 (MEIG1), a chromosome/chromatin-binding protein initially expressed during meiosis but retained in the germ cell nucleus throughout later stages of spermatogenesis. Our findings reveal an essential role for Pf20 in mouse spermatogenesis, sustaining postmeiotic germ cell viability. The different patterns of expression of the two PF20 proteins suggest the possibility that the Pf20 gene has multiple functions during spermatogenesis.},

Conjoint analysis across these molecular and neuropathological layers underscores nuclear lamina and heterochromatin erosion, resurrection of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), activated pro-inflammatory cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) signaling, and cellular senescence in post-mitotic neurons of aged NHP and human FL. Using human embryonic stem-cell-derived neurons recapitulating cellular aging in vitro, we verified the loss of B-type lamins inducing resurrection of ERVs as an initiating event of the aging-bound cascade in post-mitotic neurons. Of significance, these aging-related cellular and molecular changes can be alleviated by abacavir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, either through direct treatment of senescent human neurons in vitro or oral administration to aged mice.},

  abstract = {The successful segregation of germ cells from somatic lineages is vital for sexual reproduction and species survival. In the mouse, primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of all germ cells, are induced from the post-implantation epiblast1. Induction requires BMP4 signalling to prospective PGCs2 and the intrinsic action of PGC transcription factors3-6. However, the molecular mechanisms that connect BMP4 to induction of the PGC transcription factors that are~responsible for segregating PGCs from somatic lineages are unknown. Here we show that the transcription factor OTX2 is a key regulator of these processes. Downregulation of Otx2 precedes the initiation of the PGC programme both in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Otx2 in vitro markedly increases the efficiency of PGC-like cell differentiation and prolongs the period of PGC competence. In the absence of Otx2 activity, differentiation of PGC-like cells becomes independent of the otherwise essential cytokine signals, with germline entry initiating even in the absence of the PGC transcription factor BLIMP1. Deletion of Otx2 in vivo increases PGC numbers. These data demonstrate that OTX2 functions repressively upstream of PGC transcription factors, acting as a roadblock to limit entry of epiblast cells to the germline to a small window in space and time, thereby ensuring correct numerical segregation of germline cells from the soma.},

To address this knowledge gap, we probed chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution in the brains, hearts, skeletal muscles, and bone marrows from young, middle-aged, and old mice, and assessed age-associated changes at 353,126 candidate               cis               -regulatory elements (cCREs) across 32 major cell types. Unexpectedly, we detected increased chromatin accessibility within specific heterochromatin domains in old mouse excitatory neurons. The gain of chromatin accessibility at these genomic loci was accompanied by the cell-type-specific loss of heterochromatin and activation of LINE1 elements. Immunostaining further confirmed the loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in the excitatory neurons but not in inhibitory neurons or glial cells. Our results reveal the cell-type-specific changes in chromatin landscapes in old mice and shed light on the scope of heterochromatin loss in mammalian aging.},

The mammalian genes encode transcripts of 1.4 and 2.5 kb that are highly expressed in testis. The two transcripts appear to arise from alternative transcription start sites. The murine Pf20 gene was mapped to chromosome 1, syntenic with the location of the human gene on chromosome 2. An antibody generated against an N-terminal sequence of mouse Pf20 recognized a 71-kDa protein in sperm and testis extracts. Immunocytochemistry localized Pf20 to the tails of permeabilized sperm; electron microscope immunocytochemistry showed that Pf20 was located in the axoneme central apparatus. A murine Pf20-green fluorescent protein fusion protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells accumulated in the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with Spag6, the mammalian orthologue of Chlamydomonas PF16, Pf20 was colocalized with Spag6 on polymerized microtubules. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated interaction of the Pf20 WD repeats with Spag6. Pf20 was markedly reduced in sperm collected from mice lacking Spag6, which are infertile due to a motility defect. Our observations provide the first evidence for an association between mammalian orthologues of two Chlamydomonas proteins known to be critical for axoneme structure and function.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Tumorigenesis is a multistep process, with oncogenic mutations in a normal cell conferring clonal advantage as the initial event. However, despite pervasive somatic mutations and clonal expansion in normal tissues, their transformation into cancer remains a rare event, indicating the presence of additional driver events for progression to an irreversible, highly heterogeneous, and invasive lesion. Recently, researchers are emphasizing the mechanisms of environmental tumor risk factors and epigenetic alterations that are profoundly influencing early clonal expansion and malignant evolution, independently of inducing mutations. Additionally, clonal evolution in tumorigenesis reflects a multifaceted interplay between cell-intrinsic identities and various cell-extrinsic factors that exert selective pressures to either restrain uncontrolled proliferation or allow specific clones to progress into tumors. However, the mechanisms by which driver events induce both intrinsic cellular competency and remodel environmental stress to facilitate malignant transformation are not fully understood. In this review, we summarize the genetic, epigenetic, and external driver events, and their effects on the co-evolution of the transformed cells and their ecosystem during tumor initiation and early malignant evolution. A deeper understanding of the earliest molecular events holds promise for translational applications, predicting individuals at high-risk of tumor and developing strategies to intercept malignant transformation.},

The functional significance of MeCP2 to the mammalian nervous system is highlighted by the discovery that mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a devastating neurological disease that shares many features with autism. Synaptic scaling is a form of non-Hebbian homeostatic plasticity that allows neurons to regulate overall excitability in response to changes in network neuronal activity levels. While it is known that neuronal activity can induce phosphorylation of MeCP2 and that MeCP2 can regulate synaptic scaling, the molecular link between MeCP2 phosphorylation and synaptic scaling remains undefined. We show here that MeCP2 phosphorylation is specifically required for bicuculline-induced synaptic scaling down in mouse hippocampal neurons and this phenotype is mediated by mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5). Our results reveal an important function of MeCP2 in regulating neuronal homeostasis and may eventually help us understand how MECP2 mutations cause RTT.},

MeCP2 is expressed in many mammalian tissues and functions as a global repressor of transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 dysfunction leads to the neural-specific phenotypes of RTT remain poorly understood. Here, we show that neuronal activity and subsequent calcium influx trigger the de novo phosphorylation of MeCP2 at serine 421 (S421) by a CaMKII-dependent mechanism. MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation is induced selectively in the brain in response to physiological stimuli. Significantly, we find that S421 phosphorylation controls the ability of MeCP2 to regulate dendritic patterning, spine morphogenesis, and the activity-dependent induction of Bdnf transcription. These findings suggest that, by triggering MeCP2 phosphorylation, neuronal activity regulates a program of gene expression that mediates nervous system maturation and that disruption of this process in individuals with mutations in MeCP2 may underlie the neural-specific pathology of RTT.},

A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC).|When the read counts are low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference.|The apeglm package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/apeglm, and the methods can be called from within the DESeq2 software.|Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},

Strikingly, about 40\% of lncRNAs are expressed specifically in the brain with precisely regulated temporal and spatial expression patterns. In stark contrast to the highly conserved repertoire of protein-coding genes, thousands of lncRNAs have newly appeared during primate nervous system evolution with hundreds of human-specific lncRNAs. Their evolvable nature and the myriad of potential functions make lncRNAs ideal candidates for drivers of human brain evolution. The human brain displays the largest relative volume of any animal species and the most remarkable cognitive abilities. In addition to brain size, structural reorganization and adaptive changes represent crucial hallmarks of human brain evolution. lncRNAs are increasingly reported to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes suggested to underlie human brain evolution, including proliferation, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, as well as in neuroplasticity. Hence, evolutionary human brain adaptations are proposed to be essentially driven by lncRNAs, which will be discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {Genomic DNA that resides in the nuclei of mammalian neurons can be as old as the organism itself. The life span of nuclear RNAs, which are critical for proper chromatin architecture and transcription regulation, has not been determined in adult tissues. In this work, we identified and characterized nuclear RNAs that do not turn over for at least 2 years in a subset of postnatally born cells in the mouse brain. These long-lived RNAs were stably retained in nuclei in a neural cell type–specific manner and were required for the maintenance of heterochromatin. Thus, the life span of neural cells may depend on both the molecular longevity of DNA for the storage of genetic information and also the extreme stability of RNA for the functional organization of chromatin.           ,              Editor’s summary                            RNA is generally considered a short-lived mediator of genetic information. Zocher               et al               . discovered that certain nuclear RNAs produced during postnatal development can persist for years in a subset of cells in the mammalian brain (see the Perspective by Lawrence and Hall). The authors also showed that some of these long-lived RNAs play a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity and cellular plasticity. Because adult mammals have limited capacity to replace neurons, the longevity of these RNAs could be critical for lifelong function of the brain but might also contribute to its age-dependent decline. —Stella M.

Loss of G9a or EZH2 results in upregulation of distinct gene sets involved in cell cycle regulation, germline development and embryogenesis. Notably, the H3K9me2 modification extends to active enhancer elements where it promotes developmentally-linked gene silencing and directly marks promoters and gene bodies. This epigenetic mechanism is important for priming gene regulatory networks for critical cell fate decisions in rapidly proliferating postimplantation epiblast cells.},

  abstract = {A recent study by Gabel et al. (2015) found that Mecp2, the gene mutated in Rett syndrome, represses long ({$>$} 100 kb) genes associated with neuronal physiology and connectivity by binding to methylated CA sites in DNA. This study adds to a growing body of literature implicating gene length and transcriptional mechanisms in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.},
